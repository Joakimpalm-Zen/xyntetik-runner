"""Thane compatibility: the schema shapes Xyntetik Thane actually sends.

Thane (xyntetik-thane) is Runner's primary in-suite consumer and it pins
``xyntetik-runner-client @ git+...xyntetik-runner.git@main``, so a Runner
change lands in Thane the moment it merges. Every request shape asserted here
is a verbatim structural copy of what ``thane/context.py`` builds today:

* ``action_schema()`` — a ``oneOf`` union of one branch per tool, each branch
  discriminated by ``{"tool": {"const": <name>}}``, with ``required`` and
  ``additionalProperties: false`` at both the branch and the ``args`` level.
* ``_SUMMARY_SCHEMA`` — the compaction summary object, which carries
  ``required`` but deliberately no ``additionalProperties``.

The schemas are reproduced here rather than imported: this suite must not
depend on xyntetik-thane being installed, and pinning the shape locally is the
point — if Thane's real schema drifts from this copy, that is a Thane change that
should be made deliberately, and if Runner stops accepting this copy, Thane
breaks in the field.

The keyword gate added in "schema: reject unenforceable JSON Schema keywords"
makes these acceptance tests load-bearing: several constructs Thane relies on
sit next to constructs that are now rejected, and two of them (an empty
``required`` list, and a *property named* ``pattern``) are close enough to
rejected forms that a stricter gate could plausibly catch them by accident.
