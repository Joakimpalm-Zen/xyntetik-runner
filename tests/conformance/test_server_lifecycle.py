    Runner is deliberately ASYMMETRIC, and both halves are load-bearing:

      * WITH a constraint (json_schema / json_object / tools) the prelude is
        bounded at max_new/2, and hitting that bound CLOSES the prelude and
        spends the rest of the budget on the payload, because the caller is
        owed a document. Pinned by the two tests above. That is the shape
        Anthropic's extended thinking uses -- thinking gets its own budget
        under max_tokens and the answer is still produced.
      * WITHOUT one there is NO prelude bound at all. The turn runs to
        max_tokens like any other, `finish_reason` is the plain "length", and
        no `finish_detail` appears because the prelude cap never fired. That
        resembles OpenAI's reasoning models, where reasoning and output share
        the ceiling and a reasoning-heavy turn can return little or nothing.

    This second half had nothing pinning it, and the gap was not harmless: the
    engine carried an unreachable `else` branch that ENDED the turn at the
    bound, and on 2026-08-15 it was read as the unconstrained policy and
    described to the owner as one. The branch is gone; this test is what stops
    the question being re-answered from a code path nobody can reach.
