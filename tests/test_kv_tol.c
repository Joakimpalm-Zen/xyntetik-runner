// Phase 8: a SOUND correctness gate for the q8_0 KV cache on the GPU.
//
// The gate this replaces asserted that a free-running greedy generation with
// a q8 cache produced token-identical text on GPU and CPU. That gate cannot
// be made to pass, and — more importantly — it was never measuring what it
// claimed to measure:
//
//   * Free-running generation feeds its own argmax back in. One last-ulp
//     difference at one near-tie changes the next token, which changes every
//     token after it. So the metric is not "how wrong is the kernel" but
//     "how many near-ties did this prompt happen to contain", which is a
//     property of the prompt and the model, not of the code under test.
//   * q8_0's step is amax/127 per 32-value block, roughly 15x coarser than
//     fp16 near the same magnitude. Reassociation noise that fp16 absorbs
//     silently can move a q8 value by a whole quantization level. This is
//     not hypothetical: on gemma-3-4b the same divergence reproduces with no
//     GPU involved at all, CPU-only, purely by changing -b 64 to -b 1.
//
// So token identity under q8 is not a property the implementation can have,
// and a gate that demands it is a gate that will be disabled.
//
// What this test measures instead is TEACHER-FORCED agreement. Every
// configuration is fed the *same* fixed token sequence at every position, so
// no configuration is ever reacting to its own earlier divergence, and the
// difference between two logit vectors at a given position is purely numeric.
//
// The tolerance is not a magic constant, and it is not a guess about how
// close two q8 implementations "ought" to be. It is calibrated against a
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: the CPU q8 path compared against *itself*, run with a
// different prompt batch size.
//
//     reassoc = mean|q8_cpu(b=1) - q8_cpu(b=64)|    no GPU involved at all
//     impl    = mean|q8_gpu      - q8_cpu(b=64)|
//
// Changing the batch size only reassociates the same sums — it is a
// mathematically equivalent computation, so `reassoc` is pure floating-point
// noise passed through the quantizer. It is the floor: no faithful q8
// implementation can do better, because q8's step is ~15x coarser than fp16
// and last-ulp input differences therefore reach the logits amplified.
//
// The gate is that the GPU differs from the CPU by no more than a small
// multiple of what the CPU already differs from itself. That is a property a
// correct implementation genuinely has, it needs no per-model tuning, and a
// layout bug, a wrong scale, or a mis-sliced head cannot satisfy it — those
// produce differences orders of magnitude above the reassociation floor.
//
// mean|q8_cpu - f16_cpu| (the inherent cost of the format) is reported too,
// as context for how large all of these numbers are, but it is deliberately
// NOT the gate: the GPU/CPU gap is a sizeable fraction of it for exactly the
// amplification reason above, and a gate demanding otherwise would be the
// same mistake as demanding token identity, one level down.
//
// The f16 invariant is checked the strict way, unchanged: f16 GPU must be
// token-identical to f16 CPU. That one IS a property the implementation has
// and must keep.
