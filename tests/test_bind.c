// The loopback bind is a product decision, and this test is the lock on it.
//
// runner's HTTP server binds INADDR_LOOPBACK and offers no way to change it:
// no --host, no --bind, no environment variable. That is not an oversight to
// be tidied up later. It is the reason two other things in this codebase are
// allowed to be as simple as they are:
//
//   1. There is no authentication on the API. Nothing in the server checks who
//      the caller is, because the kernel already did: only this machine can
//      reach the socket.
//   2. The HTTP request framing is now strict (parse_request_framing):
//      Content-Length is matched only as a complete, line-anchored header,
//      duplicate Content-Length is rejected, and Transfer-Encoding is rejected
//      outright rather than ignored — so it is not a request-smuggling
//      primitive even behind a keep-alive proxy. Here the loopback bind is
//      defense-in-depth, not the sole mitigation; but it remains the reason
//      (1) can skip authentication entirely.
//
// Since Phases 1-4 the server also does tool calling on three API surfaces,
// which is precisely the capability that turned the ~175,000 exposed Ollama
// hosts found by SentinelLabs and Censys in January 2026 into remote code
// execution. Those operators did not set out to expose anything; they set
// 0.0.0.0 for convenience and did not get to the firewall. runner does not have
// the flag they got wrong.
//
// So this test fails the build if the bind is ever weakened, whether by
// swapping the constant or by adding an option that reaches it. The runtime
// half of the gate — proving the running server is genuinely unreachable on a
// non-loopback address — lives in tests/conformance/test_loopback_bind.py.
//
// If you are here because you legitimately need remote access: the supported
// answer is a reverse proxy, an SSH tunnel or Tailscale, which is where auth
// and TLS belong. If you are here because you intend to add --host anyway,
// read SECURITY.md first: the flag may not land before the HTTP framing
// strictness fixes and an auth story.
