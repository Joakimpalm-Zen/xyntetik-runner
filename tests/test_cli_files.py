"""What the CLI binary does with its inputs and its debug switches.

Started as RNR-011 (a prompt/schema file that cannot be read must fail with a
clear error, never a crash from an unchecked ftell/fread) and now also covers
the interactive-chat input path and the sampled-token debug env var — the
places where main.c's own handling of input is the behaviour under test rather
than the engine's.
