"""scripts/type-plan-size.py: what will this --type-plan actually produce?

A --type-plan is written blind: the rules are substrings, first match wins,
and the quantizer silently declines a rule whose target block width does not
divide the tensor's row (`type_fits_row`) or that would GROW the tensor. Both
declines produce a successful build and a file that is not what the plan said.

The gate here is exactness, not an estimate: the predicted byte size must
equal the size `--quantize` actually writes, and the predicted per-type
histogram must equal the one the quantizer prints.
