// Memory-placement arithmetic that no fixture can reach: the reservation
// auto-fit (`-c 0` with --reserve-ram/--reserve-vram) and the KV-evicts-weights
// trade note.
//
// This gate exists because the behaviour it covers is unreachable on any
// machine this project is developed on. The auto-fit only runs when a budget is
// tight enough to force the context down, and the per-slot activation head
// alone is 256 MB: on an 8 GB host even a 1% reservation leaves negative room,
// so the branch returns "does not fit" and nothing downstream is exercised. The
// numbers that matter belong to 7B-and-up models on 24 GB cards. Rather than
// pretend a 135M fixture can stand in for that, the arithmetic is fed those
// numbers directly.
//
// The specific regression guarded here is real and is recorded in model.c: the
// reservation is a budget for the SERVER, not for one sequence. Weights are
// uploaded once and shared; the KV cache and activation head are paid PER SLOT.
// Billing both once over-committed a multi-slot server by nearly the slot
// count.
