# Changelog

All notable changes to xyntetik-runner (formerly gridcore-runner). This
project is **pre-1.0**: APIs, model coverage and certification envelopes may
change between releases (the `-alpha` suffix was retired at v0.2.0 — the 0.x
version already says what it needs to). Entries below the rename keep the
names that were true when they were written.

## Unreleased

- Capabilities report drafting from resident engines across all serving slots.
  Model, MTP and lookup drafts are reported active when loaded, inactive
  after unload, and refused drafts retain their reason with multiple slots.
  `mtp.consumed` reports actual head use instead of a constant false value.
- Single-model MTP serving restores the head and configured draft width after
  explicit unload, `keep_alive: 0`, and TTL expiry. Reloads repeat the CPU
  readiness gate instead of silently degrading to plain decoding.
- Model signature policy is enforced on named registry loads and reloads,
  as well as additional serving slots. A registry signature refusal returns
  HTTP 409 with `model_signature_refused`. OpenSSL-signed HTTP gates cover
  valid loads, missing signatures, tampered model bytes, and recovery.
- LoRA adapter path and scale are preserved on every target model load:
  additional serving slots, named registry entries, and reloads after unload
  or TTL expiry. A failed adapter load refuses the target; draft models do
  not inherit the target adapter. HTTP gates compare adapted and bare answers.
- Speculative decoding stops at the context boundary for model, MTP and
  lookup drafts, including unlimited generation. The final verify row no
  longer emits an extra token that makes transcript writing read beyond the
  history buffer. CLI gates pin the context arithmetic and transcript parity.

## v0.4.8 - 2026-09-05

The E-series and contraction release: Gemma 4's current shared-KV exports
load, the CPU prefill dot gives one answer whatever the batch shape, and the
serving surface gains `cached_tokens`, `GET /metrics` and a fourth draft
source that needs no weights.


- **Batched prefill dot: blocking-independence by construction, not by
  codegen luck.** The CPU prefill kernel (`vec_dot_f32_multi` and the 4x4
  tile over it) promises that a column's bits do not depend on how many
  columns travel with it; that is what lets one binary give the same
  logits whatever batch shape the scheduler, the prefix cache or `-b`
  hands it. The promise held on clang and broke on GCC hosts: the scalar
  tail (the last n mod 8 elements of a row) was written `s += w[i] * x[i]`,
  which GCC may contract into one fused multiply-add or round the product
  first, and it decided per loop shape (`-ffp-contract=fast` is its gnu11
  default, independent of `-ffast-math`, which the kernels are built
  without). Measured with GCC 15 at `-march=x86-64-v3` and native on an
  AVX-512 host: the 4-column block's tail compiled to `vmulps` plus
  `vaddss`, the 1- and 8-column tails to a `vmulps` quad plus
  `vfmadd231ss`, and the same column differed by one ulp between blockings
  (14 pairs in the gate); the ubuntu-latest CI hosts (GCC at `-march=native`) split the 8-column block from
  the 1-column path the same way (`make-test`, 2026-09-02). Every f32 dot
  tail is now an explicit `fmaf`, which has exactly one admissible result,
  so all blockings sum identically whatever the compiler unrolls or
  vectorizes; the SIMD bodies (already FMA intrinsics) are unchanged and
  the assembly shows no rounded product left in either kernel on GCC 15 or
  clang 22 at native, v4 and v3. Exposure, precisely: the split is
  the compiler's, not the ISA's. GCC 15 fails the old kernel at
  `-march=x86-64-v3` too, the level the Linux and Windows release binaries
  pin, so those builds carried the same tail codegen; clang builds (the
  macOS release, a local clang `make`) did not. What it could have moved:
  the row length here is a projection's input width, a multiple of 8 in
  every family in the roster, so the tail never ran for a shipped model and
  no token could have depended on batch shape; the hole was in the kernel
  contract the register blocking rests on, which is exactly what the gate
  pins so the blocking can widen without touching the token contract.
  `make test` now compares every
  column of every blocking against a fixed-order scalar reference (the
  kernel's summation order written out with explicit `fmaf`, so the bits
  come from a written order rather than from the kernel under another
  blocking; it caught 358 cases on GCC where every blocking had drifted
  together and the old relative check saw 14) and against an exactly
  representable integer anchor; CI adds a `simd-isa-levels` job that builds
  the gate at `ARCH_FLAGS=-march=x86-64-v3` (the release pin) and at
  `-march=x86-64-v4` on purpose, the latter skipping with a printed reason
  on a runner without AVX-512. Prefill throughput unchanged, as
  the shape says it must be (a shipped model never runs the tail):
  SmolLM2-135M Q8_0 on an M1 CPU, six interleaved runs each, median 463.8
  prompt tok/s before and 463.9 after; greedy tokens identical.
- **Gemma 4 E-series: the current shared-KV exports load.** A layer at or
  past `block_count - attention.shared_kv_layers` computes no K and no V - it
  attends over the cache an earlier layer filled - so its `attn_k.weight`,
  `attn_v.weight` and `attn_k_norm.weight` are unreachable, and every
  quantized E-series export published since the BF16 one leaves them out
  (E4B: 666 tensors where the BF16 export has 720; layers 24..41 carry 14
  tensors each instead of 17). The loader demanded all three on every
  attention layer, so 0.4.7 refused Google's own QAT Q4_0 release, the
  ggml-org Q4_0 and the community QAT F16 conversion at load with
  `error: missing tensor blk.24.attn_k.weight`. They are now optional on
  exactly the shared-KV tail and still required on every KV-owning layer,
  where a missing one is refused by name as before. The E4B file pinned in
  the compat matrix is an older full-form conversion, which is why the matrix
  never saw this.
  Three gates, evidence in
  `docs/compat-reports/eseries-shared-kv-2026-09-04/`. (1) The anchor:
  `scripts/gguf-drop-shared-kv.py` (new) rewrote the local 720-tensor
  Q4_K_M into the 666-tensor form, dropping exactly 54 tensors on layers
  24..41 with all 666 survivors SHA-256 identical to their source blobs; the
  two files then score byte-identically (`--score`, 36 positions solo and 159
  chunked over the house corpus) and generate byte-identical greedy output.
  Unreachable weights must move no bit. (2) Google's official QAT Q4_0
  (`gemma-4-E4B_q4_0-it.gguf`, 5,154,941,280 bytes, 666 tensors) loads,
  answers the chat smoke and scores `nll_mean` 3.53626308 / `ppl` 34.3383595
  over the same 159 positions; it joins the pinned manifest as
  `gemma-4-e4b-it-qat-q4_0` with a macOS CPU ledger row. Cross-engine
  agreement was not measured for it and is not claimed. (3) The gate CI runs:
  `scripts/make-test-model.py --drop-kv shared|<layers>` builds the same
  shape at fixture scale, and `tests/test_eseries.py` pins that a compact
  fixture loads, that it is bit-identical to the full one, and that a
  KV-owning layer missing its K is still refused with the exact error text.

- **`--draft-lookup`: prompt-lookup drafts, the fourth draft source.** The
  verify walk that checks a draft model's proposals, the MTP head's and
  grammar fast-forward's now also takes proposals from the context itself:
  each round the last n tokens (n from 5 down to 3, longest match first) are
  searched for in the prompt plus everything generated so far, and the tokens
  that followed their most recent earlier occurrence are drafted, up to
  `--draft-k`, continuing the match's own period past the context end. No
  weights, no draft forward, and no match drafts nothing, so a round without
  one costs plain decoding plus an integer search. Output stays
  token-identical to plain decoding, greedy and seeded, because the target
  decides every token; `make test` pins that on a repeating prompt, a prompt
  with no repeats and a tool-echo chat, pins the search against hand-computed
  proposals, and pins the accounting: `runner_telemetry.speculation` (source,
  rounds, drafted, accepted, and the lookup's share), the transcript's
  `speculation` object, `draft.source` in `GET /v1/capabilities`, and the
  three `runner_speculation_*` counters on `/metrics`, which keep counting
  every source. One draft source per run: `--draft-lookup` beside `--draft`
  or `--mtp` is refused at startup. Measured 2026-09-04 on an M1 CPU
  (`docs/context-drafts.md`, unrelated-prompt rows included): 1.47x on a
  verbatim repeat and parity elsewhere on SmolLM2-135M Q8_0; a loss on every
  row but the repeat on the compute-bound TinyLlama-1.1B Q2_K, since a
  rejected draft is a wasted verify column. The bandwidth-bound 3B to 8B
  Q8_0 case the source is meant for did not fit the 8 GB box resident that
  day and is still to be measured.

- **`usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`: the prefix-cache figure in
  the field a standard client reads.** Runner has always counted, per request,
  how many prompt rows it did not have to prefill, and reported it as
  `runner_telemetry.prompt_cached_tokens`, which no OpenAI-shaped client looks
  at. It is now also carried where OpenAI carries it: on Chat Completions and
  legacy Completions (buffered and in the `stream_options.include_usage`
  chunk), and as `usage.input_tokens_details.cached_tokens` on Responses. The
  three renderings come from one function, so a client that flips `stream` on
  and off sees one shape. `prompt_tokens` keeps its meaning, cached tokens
  included, as at OpenAI, so no caller's total moves. Anthropic Messages does
  not gain it: `cache_read_input_tokens` describes Anthropic's product with
  Anthropic's semantics, and that decision stays pinned by its own test.

- **`GET /metrics`: Prometheus text exposition 0.0.4.** The counters `/health`
  and `/v1/runner/prefix-cache` already answer, in the format a monitoring
  stack ingests without a translator: requests, prompt/generated/cached
  tokens, generation seconds, microbatch steps and sequences, the
  prefix-cache hit/miss/store/eviction/reuse counters and its byte and entry
  gauges, the speculation round/drafted/accepted counters, and the two RSS
  gauges. Names carry the `runner_` prefix, each sample is preceded by its own
  `# HELP` and `# TYPE`, and a body that would not fit its buffer is refused
  rather than truncated - a half-written exposition reads to a scraper as
  metrics that reset. On whenever `--serve` is, no flag, answered from the
  accept thread with atomic loads only, and it does not count its own
  requests. Advertised as `features.prometheus_metrics`.

## v0.4.7 - 2026-09-04

The sublayer-removal release: the first artifact whose header says a block
has no attention, and the loader that reads it.


- **`--remove-sublayer attn:N[,mlp:M,...]`: a block's attention or dense-FFN
  tensors are physically dropped from the file, and the absence is declared
  with a `0` in the per-block `attention.head_count` / `head_count_kv` (or
  `feed_forward_length`) array, the convention llama.cpp's Nemotron-51B
  ("deci") files already use. The loader omits the branch instead of failing
  on a missing tensor, reserves no KV rows for a removed attention, refuses a
  declaration whose tensors are still present, and keeps refusing an
  undeclared missing tensor. Gated on bit-identity against the parent with
  the block's output projection zeroed (an independent path through the full
  math), exact byte accounting, and the KV cache halving on a two-block
  fixture. CPU path and dense blocks only; MoE FFNs, hybrid families,
  E-series, fused-QKV, NextN heads, `--lora` and `--train` are declined by
  name. Norms stay (kilobytes; the residual plumbing is unchanged).
  Measured on the real Gemma 4 31B Q4_0 (`docs/sublayer-removal.md`): the
  `attn:48` cut drops 74,319,872 bytes of tensor data, frees 64 MiB of KV at
  ctx 4,096 and 512 MiB at 32,768, scores bit-identically to the same cut as
  a zeroed-weights file over 4,562 positions, and passes the raw-protocol
  bar at KLD 0.0239; stock llama.cpp refuses the file by name, the intended
  failure. The artifact is published as
  `Joakimpalm-Zen/gemma-4-31B-it-attn48-removed-Q4_0-GGUF` and needs this
  release or later to load.

- **Gemma-4 E-series is a value, not a key.** Every gemma-4 export carries
  `embedding_length_per_layer_input` and `attention.shared_kv_layers`; the
  dense 12B/26B/31B files publish them as 0. The writer refused the 31B on
  key presence and now refuses on a non-zero value, as the loader does. The
  gemma4-hetero fixture carries both keys at 0.

- **The compat harness tells "did not execute" from "failed" on a shared
  device.** A CUDA side refused for a stated VRAM reason (`error: ... of
  VRAM requested ... but only ... is available`) is recorded as
  `not_executed` / `insufficient_vram` with the line, never as a failed
  identity; `cpu_cuda_check.py` now surfaces the backend log's error lines
  when the server dies during startup. A CPU-only matrix (`--gpu off`) runs
  the chat smoke on the CPU path even where the row pins `auto`, instead of
  waiting 300 s for VRAM and timing out without asking the question. Both
  found on the 2026-09-04 Blackwell matrix, whose MIG slice was shared with
  a running study.

## v0.4.6 - 2026-09-02

- **The compat harness classifies an unbuilt tokenizer tool as `not_executed`**
  (with the reason) instead of failing sixteen tokenizer rows, and its chat
  smoke asks the model for no thinking unless the pinned params say
  otherwise; the 2026-09-02 Blackwell matrix ran every executable class on
  all 25 pinned files (`docs/compat-reports/0.4.5-2026-09-02-blackwell.json`).

- **Benchmarks refreshed 2026-09-02 on three hosts** against current
  llama.cpp builds (`docs/benchmarks.md`): MIG dense decode 81-93%, MoE
  72%/41%, prefill 5-10%; RTX 3070 decode 70-83%, prefill 4-9%; M1 Metal
  granite-3b decode 80% under memory pressure. Prefill is the column.

- **Signed, chained receipts, and OpenSSF Model Signing verification at
  load.** A transcript can now be signed (`--keygen` makes an Ed25519 key,
  `--sign-key` signs every byte before the record's `,"signature"` key,
  chain hash included) and linked (`--transcript-prev` puts the previous
  receipt's chain hash in `chain.prev`), and `--verify` checks signature,
  trust (`--trust-key`, `--require-signed`), link and replay under one exit
  code, with `signed`, `public_key` and `prev` in the verdict JSON; every
  forgery class is `UNVERIFIABLE` before the model is loaded. At load,
  `--model-sig` / `--model-pubkey` / `--require-signed-model` verify an OMS
  bundle for the GGUF: ECDSA (P-256/384/521, a plain Montgomery/Jacobian
  verifier gated by RFC 6979 vectors) over the DSSE PAE, the in-toto
  statement, and the file digest against the manifest; key method only,
  certificate and keyless bundles are refused as unsupported. Anchors: the
  Ed25519 module is TweetNaCl's public-domain signing subset gated by RFC
  8032 vectors and cross-checked by an independent library in the tests;
  the OMS verifier verifies bundles written by the reference signer
  (`model_signing` 1.1.1). The receipt records the model-signature verdict.

- **`--mtp` drafts from the model's own NextN/MTP predictor block.** An
  export that declares one predictor block (`<arch>.nextn_predict_layers = 1`,
  the MTP-preserved Qwen3.5/3.6 GGUFs) can now speculate without a second
  model: the block is bound as one more attention layer over its own KV
  region, fed `eh_proj(concat(enorm(embed(x_p)), hnorm(h_{p-1})))` per
  position with the reference graph's ordering, and its greedy proposals go
  through the existing target-exact verify walk, so the sampled stream is
  token-identical to plain decoding (fixture-gated at every draft width; the
  real-model anchor is the measured acceptance, 75-94% for the first draft on
  Qwen3.5-4B). CPU path only for now; an explicit `--mtp` fails closed on an
  export without a consumable head or on a GPU-resident target. Without the
  flag nothing changes. Measured 2026-09-02: 1.31x decode on code and 1.08x
  on prose at `--draft-k 1` on a 32-thread AVX-512 box with
  `RUNNER_CPU_I8=1`; a 4-core AVX2 desktop decodes slower at every width.
  `docs/performance.md` has the numbers and the profile.

- **The speculative walk no longer pays a solo forward per round.** The token
  that ends a round (bonus or mismatch) used to be forwarded alone, then the
  next round's drafts verified in a second batched pass: two full weight
  passes per round, which on a memory-bound CPU decode ate the whole gain
  (NextN drafts at 73% first-token acceptance decoded SLOWER than plain). The
  pending token now rides as row 0 of the next verify batch, and generation
  end forwards the last pending token so the KV covers `hist[0..pos)` exactly
  as before. Applies to draft models and grammar drafts too. `RUNNER_SPEC_PROF=1`
  prints the walk's per-phase time (draft, verify, row logits, recurrent
  fold re-sync, tail).

- **Small CPU batches (2-7 rows) take the solo step's native dot per column**
  instead of the dequantize-to-f32 route, rows outer so a weight row is
  streamed once and re-read from cache per column. A 2-row verify used to
  cost about two solo forwards; it now costs one weight pass plus a dot. The
  route also makes a verify row's logits bit-identical to the solo forward of
  that token (previously the two paths accumulated differently and agreed at
  near-ties only by luck). Batches of 8 and up keep the f32 tile.

- **Batched CPU prefill is 30-65% faster, bit-identically.** The kernel that
  dots a dequantized weight row against the batch's activation columns was
  load-bound (one weight load and one activation load per FMA) and dominated a
  CPU prefill profile at 5578 of ~8000 samples. It now runs a 4x4 register
  tile over 16-column chunks, so 16 FMAs ride on 8 loads and the activation
  block stays in L1: **+64.6% on an M1 (NEON), +36.8% and +30.5% on an AVX2
  desktop, +43% and +57% on a loaded AVX-512 Threadripper**, decode unchanged (decode never reaches the tile). Every output
  keeps one accumulator walking the row in one order, so results are
  bit-identical; `test-quants-simd` gates blocking-independence across every
  boundary and `kernel-verify.py` confirms token identity between binaries. A
  4x8 tile was measured first and is SLOWER on ARM64 (32 accumulators plus
  operands spill 32 NEON registers); the negative is in
  `docs/performance.md`.

- **`--prune-experts` writes `<arch>.expert_count_per_layer`**, a u32 array
  with one entry per block, whenever a plan applies (uniform or not), and the
  loader validates it against every router tensor, refusing a header that
  disagrees with the tensors by name. A non-uniform prune used to leave the
  single global `expert_count` at the parent's value with nothing in the file
  saying which layers carried fewer experts; Runner read the routers and was
  correct, while any consumer trusting the header was mis-sized. A plain
  requant carries the key through; a second plan re-authors it. Gated in
  `tests/test_prune_experts.py`.

- **NVFP4 decodes correctly: the per-tensor scale companion is applied.**
  NVIDIA's ModelOpt export is two-level (UE4M3 block scales inside the block,
  one F32 `<base>.scale` beside the weight, applied in the graph); the block
  decode was byte-identical to llama.cpp's from the start and the companion
  was never read, so every NVFP4 weight served about 7,200x too large and a
  model loaded, generated, and was wrong (the v0.4.3 known issue, field-
  reported on a DGX Spark). The GGUF loader now binds `<base>.scale` by name
  and shape for ANY weight type (the companion survives requantization; an
  F16 re-export carries it too) and the CPU dot seam applies it; the training
  transpose, embedding lookups and `tensor_to_f32` follow. `input_scale` is
  deliberately not applied. Both GPU backends keep a companion-carrying tensor
  on the CPU rather than run an unscaled device kernel, and `--merge-lora`
  refuses a scaled base. Gate: `tests/test_nvfp4_scale.py`, a two-level NVFP4
  fixture (`make-test-model.py --quant nvfp4`) scored against the same values
  as F32 with the companion folded in (`--quant nvfp4-dequant`); the fixture
  reproduced the 0.66-nat defect before the fix. Verified on a real 9B NVFP4
  file against llama.cpp's completion of the same prompt.
- **The release gate refuses a compat report in which nothing ran.** v0.4.5
  shipped `docs/compat-reports/0.4.5-2026-09-01-macos.json` with 25 models and
  every check `not_executed` (the release box had 2 of the 25 files);
  `check-release.py` asked only that a dated file exist. It now requires at
  least one executed check across the version's reports, and says so.
- **The serve log's "weights not resident" note no longer fires on Windows
  at full speed.** The Windows fault counter includes soft faults, and a
  resident model showed a few hundred per request; the note now needs at
  least 64 page-ins per token, the shape of real eviction (millions per
  request on a paging M1), gated in `test-paging-warn`.
- README: the backend tensor-format table names NVFP4 and the IQ1-IQ3
  families as CPU-only instead of claiming the GPUs cover the full CPU list;
  operator-facing `RUNNER_VRAM_REGISTRY_DIR`, `RUNNER_MOE_EAGER` and
  `RUNNER_CUDA_GRAPH_OFF` documented; a per-tensor-scale-companions section.
  `scripts/README.md` lists every script.

- **`scripts/tool-choice-boundary.py`: an unlabeled tool-choice
  decision-boundary lane over `choice_logprobs`.** Runs a bank of ambiguous
  tool-choice prompts under several serving conditions (base, adapters), one
  fresh serve each, and records per prompt the grammar decision at which the
  tool is chosen: legal alternatives, top branch, runner-up read at the tool
  level (a shorter piece of the same name is never the runner-up), raw-logprob
  margin, coverage, the full deterministic call, and provenance (bank,
  template, model and adapter sha256, runner version). `summarize` reports
  where conditions disagree and how tight the margins were, with no accuracy
  or label field anywhere (pinned by test; the records cannot feed
  `cl-calibration.py`). Ships John6666's 36-prompt boundary bank
  byte-identical under its MIT OR Apache-2.0 licence, with credit. Run
  against the published precision-study artifacts: 3 of 36 prompts split
  across the BF16/Q8/Q4-trained adapters, two of them newly found in a family
  the original Q4-margin screen could not reach (`docs/tool-choice-boundary-lane.md`).
- **`--yarn-factor F` overrides a model's native YaRN factor at runtime**,
  preserving its original context and correction parameters. Refuses models
  without YaRN metadata and conflicts with `--rope-scale` (which stays the
  linear override). Fixture support and CLI tests included.
- **`--context-surgery OUT` compiles `-c TARGET --yarn-factor F` into a
  standalone native-YaRN GGUF** without touching a single weight: the target
  must equal original context x factor and extend both source values, every
  tensor payload is independently reparsed and byte-compared before the write
  is accepted (a mismatch deletes the output), and an `OUT.context.json`
  provenance record carries base/target sha256s and both parameter sets. This
  is the instrument behind the gpt-oss-120b 262K/524K research artifacts,
  which remain unqualified for long-context use.
- **`scripts/kv-quality.py` stops trusting its own assumptions**: it now
  discovers the served model id from `/v1/models` instead of hard-coding one,
  and reserves its token budget for task answers by sending
  `enable_thinking:false` - a Harmony model was previously spending the whole
  24-token ceiling in `reasoning_content` and scoring 0/9 with empty answers
  on a control that then scored 9/9. Both behaviors are pinned by regression
  tests.

- **`--gpu auto` ignored the KV ring when deciding how many layers fit.** The
  CUDA placement loop charged every layer `2 * n_ctx * row_bytes` while the
  allocation it was predicting is sized from `model_kv_boundary_bytes`, which
  already gives a ringed sliding layer its ring rows and a shared-KV layer
  nothing beyond its owner's. So a ring run kept the flat split and left the
  savings idle: field-reported on a 24 GB MIG (Gemma-4-31B at 16k: 44/60
  layers with 9.8 GB unused), reproduced on an RTX 3070 (gemma-3-4b at 32k:
  32/34 both ways, 3.31 GB idle under the ring). The estimator now charges
  each layer its boundary delta - the same account MemAlloc reads - so the
  ring run takes the full 34/34 offload with the estimate matching the
  allocation, the flat split is byte-for-byte unchanged, and a shared-KV
  layer is no longer double-charged. Verified on the 3070: identical greedy
  output across arms, CUDA smoke green.

## v0.4.5 - 2026-09-01

- **The fusion byte-identity contract was resting on a per-device codegen
  coincidence, and the release gate on an M1 caught it.** Every rope-bearing
  kernel (k_rope, the fused k_rope_store, the attention-front megakernel)
  wrote the same rotation expressions, but under fast math cos/sin inline as
  polynomial chains whose fma contraction the compiler chooses per call site:
  the M5 Max this program was built on contracted them alike, the M1 running
  the release gates did not, and fused decode diverged from unfused at ULP
  scale - which made `test-batch-identity`, `test-metal-fuse` and the
  `--score` byte-compare all honestly red on that machine. The rotation is now
  one shared helper: `precise::cos`/`precise::sin` (one defined routine
  instead of a per-kernel polynomial) with contraction pinned off across the
  two multiplies and the sub/add. Byte identity across kernels now holds by
  construction rather than by compiler luck, on every device. Metal rope
  numerics shift at ULP scale relative to v0.4.4; every identity and
  tolerance gate in `make test` passes on the changed arithmetic. The lesson
  is the wide-front lesson again, one level down: "same expression, same
  contraction" is not a fact the language guarantees, and only running the
  gates on a SECOND device family made that visible.
- **Decode on Metal was paying for 686 kernel dispatches per token, and now
  pays for ~330.** The whole decode path was profiled to the microsecond class
  on a 128 GB M5 Max (docs/metal-decode-dispatch-budget-2026-09-01.md) and the
  dispatch chain cut in three phases: three budget-line fusions, then an
  attention-front megakernel (norm + Q/K/V + qk-norm + rope + KV-store as one
  dispatch, whole heads per threadgroup), then a widened front with the
  post-FFN residual add folded into the MoE expert sum. Net: **-52% dispatches
  per token, +5-6% decode on gpt-oss-120b and Qwen3-30B-A3B, byte-identical**,
  gated across a six-architecture roster (`test-metal-fuse`). The megakernel
  admits MoE models only: a fast dense model is matvec-bound and measured
  slower under it. Honest cuts along the way: the wide no-staging front was
  removed because fast-math fma contraction broke logprob identity on a real
  70B, and the per-type logprob gates written for that hunt caught a latent
  q4_0 front break before it shipped. `RUNNER_METAL_FUSE=0` restores the
  unfused path everywhere; `RUNNER_METAL_FRONT=0` disables just the megakernel.
- **`--parallel` slots on Metal now decode as one microbatch.** Ready slots
  share a single weight sweep per step instead of paying one full sweep each,
  measured 1.45-1.47x aggregate decode at 4-8 slots on an M5 Max, and
  **bit-identical to sequential decode** by twin-kernel construction, gated in
  `make test` (`test-batch-identity`) and mutation-proven. Dense models only;
  MoE and recurrent families decode sequentially. `RUNNER_METAL_BATCH=0`
  restores sequential.
- **Grouped simdgroup-MMA MoE prefill is the new Metal default** (ratified
  2026-09-01): the batch's slots are sorted by expert on-GPU and each expert's
  token group runs through the dense GEMM tile structure with gathered columns
  and float-staged operands. Measured **+31% prefill on Qwen3-30B-A3B and +21%
  on gpt-oss-120b**, decode untouched. Because discrete top-k routing amplifies
  reassociation-scale perturbations into near-tie expert flips (4.6% of routing
  records, median flip margin 0.009), this path answers to the published
  dual-column fidelity bar, not byte identity, enforced mv-vs-mm by
  `test-moe-mm-ab` in `make test`; every measured model passes with 100%
  margin-qualified top-1. `RUNNER_METAL_MOE_MM=0` restores the matvec path and
  is pinned by every byte-identity gate. The expert-major alternative was
  built, measured 3-4% slower, and ships off by default as a recorded negative
  (`RUNNER_METAL_MOE_EM=1`, docs/negative-result-metal-moe-expert-major.md).
- **The KV ring now runs on Metal.** v0.4.4 shipped `RUNNER_KV_RING` with a
  Metal refusal; the store and attention kernels now resolve the same modulo
  through `kv_row_off`, gated bit-identical teacher-forced logprobs against
  the flat allocation across many ring wraps (`tests/test_kv_ring.py`,
  mutation-proven). The ring's costs are unchanged: prefix cache and partial
  rewind are refused while it is active.
- **Speculative decoding now works on a fully offloaded Metal target** -
  unified memory keeps the hidden work host-readable, so the old
  discrete-VRAM refusal no longer applies there; verify is target-exact and
  gated byte-identical against the plain path. Measure before relying on it:
  on the M5 Max the batched verify costs roughly a full decode step per
  column (the dequant ALU that hides under the bandwidth floor at batch 1
  becomes the critical path), and the measured 70B+1B pair decoded slower
  speculative than plain despite 62-70% acceptance.
- **Sharded GGUF sets take a full Metal offload.** Weight wraps are keyed by
  host address, so each part's mapping gets its own tensor-boundary wraps; a
  real 2-part 86 GB set measured byte-identical to both the CPU path and the
  single file it was merged from (`make test-metal-split`). A partial
  `--gpu-layers` split of a sharded set still refuses to CPU. The loader also
  accepts the standard compact-metadata shard form where only part one
  carries model metadata, and gates the multi-GB buffer wrap that large parts
  need. Q2_K and Q3_K sparse-expert kernels round out the low-bit roster;
  together these took Qwen3-235B-A22B (85.69 GB merged) to a full 94-layer
  Metal offload, validated with a stated caveat (the broad CPU/Metal logit
  gate does not pass; a top-8 route first flips at token 4/layer 12).
- **Four big-model Metal validations on a 128 GB M5 Max, evidence committed:**
  gpt-oss-120b fully resident (36/36 layers, 0.000215 mean logit-range
  deviation, 64.59 tok/s sustained decode, zero swap, anchored against
  same-host llama.cpp with the remaining prefill gap stated: MoE prefill
  grouping, not dense GEMM); Llama-3.3-70B Q4_0 (80/80 layers, 42.25/10.57
  tok/s); Qwen3-30B-A3B Q8_0 (183.39/65.45 tok/s); gemma-4-31B Q4_0. Plus
  measured self-sensitivity floors for the 235B and gpt-oss
  (docs/sensitivity-floors-m5max-2026-09-01.md), idle coexistence at 120B
  scale (llama-server wires +60.8 GB idle against Runner's +35 MB), and the
  local training floor at 8B and 70B.
- **`RUNNER_TIEDV` stops storing K rows the model can derive.** gemma-4's
  full-attention globals ship no `attn_v.weight` (V is the raw K projection),
  so K can be derived from the stored V at read time: on the 31B at
  `-c 32768` the K cache drops 14.76 GB to 13.42 GB. A compute-for-memory
  trade and **not byte-identical** (teacher-forced mean |dlogprob| 1.3e-3, no
  top-1 change over 297 positions); CPU-only, f16-KV-only, refuses GPU, q8
  cache and `--lora` loudly. Gate: `tests/test_tiedv.py`.
- **`RUNNER_PREFETCH` ships as an opt-in carrying its own negative result.**
  Hinting the whole weight mapping to the OS made the cold 63 GB 120B load
  60% *slower* on macOS (demand paging outruns WILLNEED readahead), so it is
  off by default and says why; Linux and Windows can measure before flipping
  it on. Related determinism fix: the auto-sized `-b` default now reads
  **total** RAM (512 at 12 GB+, 256 at 6 GB+) instead of free RAM, because
  batch size changes how reassociating prefill paths tile their sums, and a
  default read off ambient load would make the same command produce different
  tokens on a busy day.
- **`RUNNER_METAL_TENSOR=1` opts prefill into the Metal 4 MPP tensor GEMM on
  M5-class hardware** (Q4_K/Q8_0/Q4_0, per-type self-test admission, failing
  types fall back alone). Deliberately not the default: every admitted type
  was numerically sound but measured only parity with the existing simdgroup
  GEMM, short of the 1.2x promotion bar. M1-M4 never compile it.
- **`RUNNER_MOE_TRACE=routes.jsonl` on Metal now snapshots every MoE layer's
  complete pre-softmax router-logit vector** on-device before the scratch is
  reused - an experiment instrument for offline routing analysis, allocating
  nothing while unset.
- **AGENTS.md gains the publication rule**: never commit conversation content
  or session identifiers to anything that reaches a repository, and check
  repository visibility before every push; commits are signed by one trailer
  naming the agent and model that produced them.

- **gemma-4-26B-A4B produced only token id 0 on Metal, and the fix was a clamp
  that already existed six lines away.** `k_moe_actmul`'s GELU branch computed
  `tanh(0.7978845608f * (x + 0.044715f*x^3))` unclamped. Metal compiles with
  fast math, `tanh()` is evaluated through `exp(2a)`, and large |a| overflows
  to inf where `inf/inf` is NaN. The dense twin `k_gelu_mul` already carried
  `clamp(a, -16, 16)` for exactly this, added when gemma-3-4b's layer-0 gate
  hit it -- the routed-expert copy was missed. gemma-4-26B-A4B is the first
  model in the set that both routes through the MoE kernel and drives the gate
  hard enough to reach the overflow, at layer 3; every generated token came
  out as id 0 on Metal while the CPU arm answered correctly. tanh is exactly
  +/-1.0f in fp32 well inside +/-16, so the clamp cannot change a
  representable result.
  Across eight realistic prompts CPU and Metal are now byte-identical on 7 of
  8, against 0 of 8 before. The eighth answers correctly on both arms and
  diverges at token 14 on adjacent ids inside a degenerate repetition loop,
  where the CPU arm disagrees with ITSELF under `--kv q8` -- chaotic
  amplification at a near-tie, not a wrong op.
- **`make test-metal-bigmodel BIGMODEL=<path.gguf>`**: CPU/Metal token
  identity on a real artifact, opt-in by path so a checkout without weights
  stays green, `BIGPROMPT=` to pin a prompt. No fixture in the suite could
  have found the bug above -- `test-metal-gelu-overflow` exists for that exact
  hazard but exercises the dense kernel on a sub-1 MiB gemma3 fixture, which
  cannot drive fp32 to overflow.
- **`RUNNER_METAL_NAN_TRACE` now takes a level.** 1 keeps the per-layer
  residual scan; 2 probes each stage within a layer, 3 inside the gemma MoE
  FFN, 4 inside the expert matvecs. The Metal path has no `RUNNER_DEBUG_ACT`
  equivalent, so before this a NaN could be attributed to a layer and no
  further. It walked this bug from "layer 3" to "`exp:actmul[1882]`" in four
  steps.

## v0.4.4 - 2026-08-30

- **Sliding-window layers were allocated KV they can never read, and now there
  is a way to stop paying for it.** Every layer gets `n_ctx` cache rows, but a
  sliding layer clamps its attention start to `p - swa_window + 1`, so rows
  older than the window are written once and never read again. On models whose
  sliding layers are both more numerous and wider in KV than their full ones
  that is most of the cache: gemma-3-4b at `-c 32768` allocates 4563 MB and can
  reach 793 MB of it, and gemma-4-E4B 1879 MB against 558 MB. `-v` now reports
  the reachable figure beside the allocated one, and `RUNNER_KV_RING=1` gives
  those layers only the rows they can read, indexed modulo that count: 4563 MB
  becomes 800 MB, within 1% of the floor. This is a ceiling rather than a
  correctness bug -- answers were always right, the cache was simply larger
  than the model could use -- and it is the difference between a 4k context and
  a 32k one on a 24 GB device.
  The gate is the flat allocation itself. A ring holds exactly the rows the
  flat layout would have been read from, so the shipped unringed engine is the
  reference implementation: verified bit-identical, max |Δlogprob| exactly 0,
  on a CPU fixture and on an RTX 3070 at both a partial split (20 of 34 layers)
  and a full offload, 2121 scored positions each.
  **It is opt-in because it costs something.** The prefix cache and partial
  rewind address KV as flat absolute rows, so both are refused while a ring is
  active and a server loses shared-prompt reuse. Metal's attention kernels
  address the cache by absolute position too and are not ring-aware, so a Metal
  build refuses the ring with a message rather than returning wrong numbers.
- **The KV cache is addressed as flat absolute rows in more places than anyone
  had written down, and the count was wrong twice.** An external research
  branch named three host sites -- `pfx_save`/`pfx_load`, `engine_rewind`,
  `kv_upload` -- after hitting each one as a separate crash, including a
  prefix-cache overrun that was a memory-safety bug no measurement in that
  branch could see, because a one-shot `-p` never touches the prefix cache.
  Implementing the ring found a fourth host site (`kv_copyback`, identical
  shape, identical blind spot) and then a whole category the list omitted: the
  CUDA attention kernels themselves, seven KV addresses plus both store
  kernels, all indexing by absolute position. A first cut that fixed only the
  host mirrors produced `nan` for every scored position on a partial GPU split
  while the same build was bit-identical on the CPU path. Every device KV
  address now resolves through one `kv_slot()` helper, `attn_args` carries the
  ring, and the embedded PTX is regenerated. The canonical comment lives at
  `model_kv_byte_off` and says the list is a starting point rather than a proof
  of completeness, which is what it turned out to be.
- **`--score` can now check itself.** It reported plausible-looking numbers for
  models it could not score, with a correct `n_scored` and exit 0: every
  validity assertion passed, because they test that the arm RAN, not that the
  number is right. The response now carries `n_vocab` and the absolute
  next-token `top1`/`top1_rate`, which are bounded by facts outside this
  implementation -- a token with probability above 0.5 must be the argmax, and
  an argmax token must carry at least `1/n_vocab` -- so a harness can bracket
  the reported count from the reported logprobs and refuse a run that disagrees
  with itself. It immediately earned its place: an anomaly that looked absent
  on short factual English (`top1_rate` 0.707) reappeared at 0.136 on a mixed
  corpus where four control models held 0.32-0.38, which `nll_mean` alone could
  not have separated from corpus difficulty.
- **A refused draft no longer exits 0 in the local CLI.** A draft is dropped on
  a vocabulary mismatch, a fully offloaded target, an unsupported file or out
  of memory, and the run continues without it. That default is deliberate and
  unchanged, and serve mode already reports `draft.active` over
  `/v1/capabilities`. One-shot and interactive chat had no such channel: the
  drop was a stderr line beside a successful exit, so automation collecting
  stdout recorded the unaccelerated baseline and labelled it speculative
  decoding. `--draft-required` fails the run instead. It requires `--draft`,
  and it is refused in serve mode rather than accepted with no effect, because
  a guard against silent no-ops that was itself a silent no-op would be the
  failure it exists to prevent.
- **Qwen3 could not reason before calling a tool.** The constrained grammar
  admitted `<tool_call>` but not `<think>`, so a thinking model asked for a
  tool had its reasoning channel closed by the schema. The discriminator now
  covers both openings, and `atem_seq_add` enforces its own capacity rather
  than trusting its caller.
- **The polish register lands: RI-2 through RI-6.** Capabilities report the
  EFFECTIVE execution mode rather than the configured one, and qualify
  `request_telemetry` per surface instead of advertising it flatly; a declined
  type-plan rule names the tensor and type it declined rather than an aggregate
  count; every refused sampling parameter names itself; and `--help` is an
  answer on stdout rather than a diagnostic on stderr. Two of the five register
  items turned out to have false premises on inspection and were split rather
  than implemented as written -- one contradicted a recorded owner deferral,
  the other a tested contract.
- **Measured Shade findings land in the engine.** The default thread count
  gains a ceiling of 32 (machines above 64 logical CPUs were spawning more
  threads than the work could use), and the q4_0 half of the signed-weight dot
  is reverted while the q8_0 half stays -- the q8_0 form is a
  cross-microarchitecture reproducibility fix, the q4_0 form was not.
- **Smaller correctness and hardening.** The CLI rejects chat-only flags
  (`--system`, `--think`, `--no-think`) in modes that would silently discard
  them; the server advertises every public route at startup and hardens its
  prefix-cache management routes; the Windows tray refuses a spawn whose
  command line does not fit rather than truncating it; expert-dimension
  iteration in the quantizer is unsigned; the build preflights its Python
  test dependencies instead of failing halfway through a suite; ring row
  sizing saturates instead of overflowing signed arithmetic at the int
  boundary; the GPU backend identity survives a release build's
  command-line `CFLAGS`, which would otherwise have compiled the Metal
  ring refusal out of the shipped binary; and `compat_matrix.py` resolves
  the runner path before probing its version, since `Path("./runner")`
  stringifies to `runner`, is not on PATH, and silently recorded a null
  version in the committed evidence.
- **NVFP4: the gate could not have caught the bug, and now says so.** v0.4.2
  claimed a decode gate that was a transcription of the implementation, so it
  proved the implementation agreed with itself. The changelog claim is
  corrected, the limitation is recorded as a test, and `scripts/nvfp4-probe.py`
  supplies the external anchor the unit test lacked: it validates the format
  against properties the file must have, needing no reference decoder. The
  probe also corrected its own first reading -- a large decoded standard
  deviation is NOT a decode error, because the per-tensor scale is applied in
  the compute graph rather than by the block decode.
- **AGENTS.md gains the rule these releases keep re-learning:** every gate
  needs at least one assertion whose expected value comes from outside the
  system under test. A green gate with no external anchor is evidence the
  system is self-consistent, and nothing more.

## v0.4.3 - 2026-08-29

- **The integrated-device probe queried the wrong attribute, and every
  display-attached NVIDIA GPU was reported as unified memory.**
  `CU_DEV_ATTR_INTEGRATED` was defined as 17. In the CUDA driver API 17 is
  `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_KERNEL_EXEC_TIMEOUT`, which reads 1 on any GPU driving
  a display (the WDDM/X watchdog); `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_INTEGRATED` is 18. So
  v0.4.2 answered `unified_memory: true` on ordinary discrete desktop cards,
  printed the load-time unified-memory notice on them, and clamped the GPU
  offload budget to OS-available RAM. Where free system RAM is below VRAM that
  silently cuts the budget on hardware with its own dedicated pool. Measured
  on an RTX 3070 with a display attached, against a known-correct anchor so
  the numbering could not be assumed: attribute 16 `MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT`
  reads 46, which is a 3070's SM count, 17 reads 1, and 18 reads 0. The
  off-by-one is quiet in the worst direction: a headless datacenter card reads
  17 as 0 and looks correct, so it takes a desktop to fail.
- **Releases now pass a CUDA smoke gate on real hardware.**
  `scripts/cuda-smoke.py` runs against a live GPU and checks what CI cannot,
  since GitHub runners have no device and `src/cuda.c` is compiled on three
  platforms and executed by none. Its assertions are invariants rather than
  expected constants, so one script covers a discrete desktop card, a headless
  datacenter card and a unified-memory device like a DGX Spark. The central
  one is coherence: `unified_memory` is a claim that VRAM and system RAM are
  one pool, so it must agree with the sizes actually reported, and a device
  claiming unified memory while its VRAM is plainly a separate pool fails
  regardless of which attribute number the driver was asked for. It also
  cross-checks the load-time notice against `--caps`, since those come from
  different call sites and disagreeing is itself a defect.
  `scripts/cuda-smoke-remote.sh` drives it over SSH and brings the evidence
  back, and each release commits its report next to the compatibility report.
  Verified red against the v0.4.2 binary before being trusted green.

## v0.4.2 - 2026-08-29

### Qwen models speak their own tool protocol

- **Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 tool calling is native.** Declarations render into the
  family's trained `# Tools` / `<tools>` block, a call comes back as its
  `<tool_call>{"name":...,"arguments":...}</tool_call>` turn, and results
  replay as grouped `<tool_response>` blocks. Tool names and argument schemas
  are constrained directly in that native grammar
  (`schema_compile_qwen_turn`/`_parallel`) rather than through runner's
  generic JSON envelope, and buffered and streaming output map back to the
  OpenAI shape. As with every other family, the same three-turn conversation
  renders byte-identically on `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` and
  `/v1/messages`. Qwen's `<tool_call>` framing joins the list of protocols a
  `stop` string would fire inside, so stop-plus-tools stays refused.
- **Qwen3 history keeps the reference template's think framing.** The
  reference writes an empty `<think>\n\n</think>` block before a trailing
  historical assistant answer and replays `reasoning_content` there; runner
  rendered neither, so a replayed Qwen3 conversation did not match what the
  model was trained to read back. This is replay framing and is independent
  of whether the new turn enables thinking.
- **The template conformance matrix is text-only.** Its content-array row
  carried an image part, which this release refuses outright, so the row was
  comparing a prompt no accepted request can produce.

### Histories are validated before anything is rendered

An independent review pass went through the three chat surfaces asking what
happens to a request that is wrong. The answer was too often "it is repaired
and answered 200": a missing field defaulted, an unrenderable turn dropped,
an unusable ordering rewritten. A prompt that does not say what the caller
submitted is the failure mode nothing downstream can detect, so each of these
is now an HTTP 400 naming the field.

- **Every chat turn must be an object with an explicit role and usable
  content.** Roles are `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant` and `tool`
  (`developer` renders as a system instruction on local templates). A turn
  with no role used to be rendered as `user` and a turn whose content was
  neither string nor array was dropped from the prompt entirely. Assistant
  turns may still omit visible content when they carry `tool_calls` or
  `reasoning_content`.
- **Replayed `tool_calls` are checked.** An array on an assistant turn only;
  each entry an object with a non-empty `id`, `type: "function"`, a non-empty
  `function.name`, and `function.arguments` a string containing a JSON object.
- **Runner is text-only, and now says so.** Image, file and other non-text
  content parts on Chat Completions and Responses are refused instead of
  removed while the adjacent text is answered successfully. Anthropic
  `tool_result.content` gets the same rule: text blocks or a string, with a
  non-text block refused rather than JSON-dumped into the prompt.
- **A tool result that names no call is refused on every family.** Only
  Harmony refused before. Elsewhere an unattributable result rendered under
  the template's own `'unknown'` fallback, or was named after its
  `tool_call_id` - a function name invented from an identifier and declared
  nowhere.
- **Role sequences a template cannot represent are refused.** llama2, gemma,
  mistral, apertus and ornith cannot express a system turn once history has
  started, and the llama2/gemma/mistral families assert alternating
  user/assistant. One shared `template_roles_valid` enforces this for chat,
  Responses and Messages alike, instead of each surface silently rendering
  something the reference template would not. Messages keeps the documented
  mid-history system extension that Claude Code sends.
- **Responses input items are validated.** Item `type` must be `message`,
  `function_call` or `function_call_output`; a message needs a
  user/assistant/system/developer role and non-empty content; a
  `function_call` needs a non-empty `call_id` and object-valued `arguments`;
  and `function_call_output.output` is now required. An absent `output` and
  an empty string used to collapse to the same empty tool turn, so broken
  agent history looked accepted while the model was handed an event that
  never happened.
- **Anthropic tool blocks are validated.** `tool_use` only inside an
  assistant message, carrying a non-empty `id`, a non-empty `name` and an
  object `input`; `tool_result` only inside a user message, carrying a
  non-empty `tool_use_id`, required `content` and a boolean `is_error`.
- **Typed request controls are checked rather than coerced.**
  `enable_thinking` (top level and inside `chat_template_kwargs`),
  `cache_prompt`, `prefix_cache`, `stream_options` and its `include_usage`,
  Responses' `truncation`, `include`, `instructions` and `tool_choice` object
  shape, `parallel_tool_calls` (validated whether or not strict mode is on,
  where it was previously read only under strict), and a non-string `model`
  selector on any endpoint.

### Accepted-then-ignored, closed across the request surface

A full-tree sweep plus an independent review found eight more request fields
that were validated and then dropped, or normalized past the caller's
mistake. Every one answered 200 while the thing the caller reached for did
nothing. Same rule as the v0.4.1 prompt-control work: a field this engine
cannot honor is an error, never a silent default.

- **`seed: 0` is refused instead of silently randomizing.** The sampler's
  xorshift64 has a fixed point at state 0, so the engine only adopted a seed
  above zero and an explicit `0` left the inherited state: two identical
  requests asking to be reproducible diverged. The CLI has refused `-s 0` by
  name since that reasoning was first written down. Absent stays absent.
- **Anthropic `thinking` now controls rendering.** `thinking.type` was
  validated and then never read, so `{"type":"disabled"}` rendered exactly
  like a request that said nothing: the surface's own control did nothing
  while runner's `enable_thinking` extension was the only thing that worked.
  `enabled`/`disabled`/`adaptive` now map to the renderer's tri-state, with
  `enable_thinking` kept as the fallback. `budget_tokens` is validated for
  shape and range; runner does not enforce it as a hard cap (nothing makes a
  model stop reasoning at a token count) and now reports what was actually
  spent instead, below.
- **The request timeout covers prompt prefill.** The deadline was computed
  before any work but handed only to the decode loop, so a long enough prompt
  overran its own timeout by the entire prefill. It is now polled at each
  complete prefill chunk. Expiry there answers `408` naming the prompt rather
  than the `400 context overflow` a stopped prefill used to produce - the
  prompt fits, the clock ran out.
- **Responses tool history is validated.** `function_call_output.output` is
  typed as a string by the item schema and anything else was JSON-dumped
  straight into the prompt; `call_id` could be absent or a number on the
  result side while the call side had always required it; and a wrong-typed
  `function_call.name` took the deduce-from-the-sole-tool path, so a typo
  came back as a successful call to whatever the one tool was.
- **Replayed Anthropic reasoning follows the family.** A `thinking` block was
  dropped from the prompt unconditionally, while `/v1/chat/completions`
  replays Harmony reasoning on its analysis channel from `reasoning_content`
  - the same model and conversation described two different ways depending on
  which vocabulary the client spoke. Harmony now replays it on both surfaces;
  every other family still strips prior thinking, which is what its own
  template does. `redacted_thinking` is opaque and is replayed by neither.
- **Wrong-typed tool declarations are refused.** A non-string `tools[].type`
  was read as if absent and normalized to `"function"` on all three surfaces,
  and a wrong-typed `description` silently vanished from the prompt. The
  accessor that could not tell "absent" from "present with the wrong type" is
  now explicit about the difference.
- **Invalid Anthropic tool-result ordering is refused.** A `tool_result` after
  a text block in the same user message was silently REORDERED - result
  emitted first, text deferred - so an invalid conversation was answered 200
  having been rewritten into a different one.
- **Responses reports real reasoning-token usage.**
  `usage.output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` was hard-coded to zero.
  Counted per token now (a token that contributes any reasoning bytes is a
  reasoning token), which is also what makes an unenforced thinking budget
  visible to the caller.

### Latent defects found by the sweep

None reachable on the current tree; each is a hole the next change falls into.

- **The scheduler pays back its wait count on every exit.** Leaving `SEQ_WAIT`
  via the stop path did not decrement `n_wait`. Harmless while `stop` means
  only shutdown, wrong the moment it means a drain.
- **Metal checks its pipeline tables against the admission predicates.** The
  two literal lists asserted 11 of the 16 types `gpu_type_ok` admits, and the
  encoders index those tables with no nil check -
  `setComputePipelineState:nil` raises rather than returning an error. A type
  added to an allowlist without its kernel now fails the load loudly instead
  of crashing mid-forward.
- **A NUL byte in a request header is refused.** It hid the real terminator
  from every NUL-terminated parse below it, and the slot then read to its
  16 KB buffer or sat out the whole 10 s deadline before answering.
- **Smaller:** `outside_reason` no longer adds a would-have-written count to a
  length; a failed `strdup` no longer publishes an instance record with NULL
  model names behind a non-zero count; `json_escape` no longer writes its
  terminator under `cap 0`.

### HTTP framing, allocation failures, and the accept fastpath

- **The accept thread no longer drains requests.** `/health`, `/v1/models`,
  `/v1/capabilities` and `/unload` are answered straight from the accept
  loop, which used to consume the request there under a 0.5 s budget so that
  closing would not RST away its own reply - the accept thread is the only
  thing calling `accept()`, so a slow client stalled every later connection
  behind it. It now peeks the whole header and hands ANY request it cannot
  prove bodyless - partial header, oversized header, malformed framing, or a
  declared body - to a slot, whose bounded reader consumes the request before
  replying. A body sent to a bodyless route is a 400 the client actually
  receives.
- **An allocation failure is a 500, not the caller's fault.**
  `tool_envelope_build_ex` returned `-1` for a malformed request and for its
  own out of memory alike, so every surface reported an OOM as a 400. Named
  results (`TOOL_ENVELOPE_INVALID`/`_OOM`/`_NONE`/`_READY`) separate them.
  Harmony prompt rendering propagates its builder failures the same way
  (`SIZE_MAX`) instead of handing back a truncated prompt's length.
- **`/health` cannot report a truncated resident name.** Its escape buffer
  was 192 bytes against the `63 * 6 + 2` worst case `/v1/models` already
  used, so a registry name needing six-byte escapes throughout identified the
  same resident by two different strings.
- **`/v1/capabilities` reports the server's `pid`.** Needed by the Python
  launcher below, and useful to anything else that has to tell one Runner on
  a port from another.

### The Python consumer boundary

- **`ManagedRunner.start()` proves the child it spawned is the one
  answering.** Readiness was "something healthy is on the port", which a
  pre-existing Runner satisfies while the spawned child is still loading and
  about to lose `bind()`. Startup now accepts only a `/v1/capabilities` whose
  `pid` matches the process it launched.
- **Startup leases treat a zombie owner as stale.** `_process_alive`
  answered true for an unreaped zombie (`kill(pid, 0)` succeeds, and on
  Windows an exited process still opens), so a lease could be held forever by
  a process that had already exited. POSIX state comes from
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` with a `ps -o stat=` fallback; Windows uses
  `GetExitCodeProcess`. PID reuse, dead owners and zombie owners are all
  stale claims now.
- **`cancel_event` interrupts a silent stream.** Cancellation was only
  observed between SSE events, so a stream that went quiet blocked in `recv`
  until the socket timeout regardless. A watcher thread now shuts the
  response socket down, and `RunnerCancelledError.partial` still carries the
  text received before cancellation.

### First external hardware report

- **NVFP4 reads on the CPU.** NVIDIA's block-scaled FP4 (ggml type 40:
  E2M1 codes, one UE4M3 scale per 16-element sub-block, 36 bytes per
  64-element block, the format NVIDIA ModelOpt produces and the DGX Spark
  ecosystem ships) now dequantizes and serves on the CPU path, gated
  against a double-precision reference decode in test_quants_simd.
  **CORRECTION 2026-08-30: read "independent" out of that sentence, it was
  wrong.** The reference is a transcription of the implementation, so it
  proves the implementation agrees with itself and cannot detect a wrong
  element order or an ignored per-tensor scale. A DGX Spark field report
  has an NVFP4 model loading cleanly and then decoding a single repeated
  token; root cause is under investigation and NVFP4 output should not be
  trusted until an external anchor exists. See the v0.4.3 release notes.
  No other format is affected: every other type here is anchored by models
  that demonstrably serve correctly. Scalar kernels only for now, and no GPU path: CUDA and
  Metal decline it by name via their own admission tests, so `--caps`
  advertises it under `quants` and not `gpu_quants`. Both backends'
  per-type kernel tables are also resized past the new highest loadable
  type: a type-40 tensor must land on a NULL slot and decline, never
  index past the table.
- **Unified memory is detected, reported, and budgeted.** `--caps` said
  `unified_memory: false` on a DGX Spark whose GB10 is nothing but: the
  field was a compile-time constant. It is now queried from the device
  (CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_INTEGRATED), and on an integrated device the GPU
  offload budget is additionally capped at what the OS reports as
  available RAM, because "VRAM free" and "RAM free" are views of the same
  pool and treating them as two budgets over-promises. A loud one-line
  notice says so at load. Both findings come from the first external
  hardware report (DGX Spark, 2026-08-29), which also confirmed the
  arm64 + CUDA combination works.
- **Verification scope for the two items above, stated plainly.** The
  NVFP4 decode is gated by an automated test (an independent
  double-precision reference decode written from the format spec) and
  runs on every platform. The CUDA-side changes are covered by no
  automated test at all, because CI has no GPU. In particular the
  integrated-device probe and the unified-pool budget cap have not yet
  executed on integrated hardware: the field report that prompted them
  was made against v0.4.1, so the fix has not been back-confirmed on the
  machine that found the bug. Reasoned and reviewed, not yet run. Read
  the unified-memory handling as a fix awaiting its first hardware
  confirmation rather than one that has had it.

## v0.4.1 - 2026-08-28

- **Constrained output only emits numbers the parser reads back.** The
  validators and json_parse now share one number-acceptance predicate
  (`json_number_text_ok`: strtod with ERANGE, both directions). Previously a
  schema-constrained model could complete `9e999` or a deep-subnormal
  spelling that the runner's own parser - and therefore its tool-argument
  readback - refuses; the validator's old `isfinite()` overflow check was
  dead code in the shipped build because -ffast-math folds it away, exactly
  the trap json.c's parser documented for itself. The refusal lands on the
  exponent digit that commits the spelling, so terminating the number always
  stays legal, and the closer's keep-the-prefix fallback is now sound for
  every reachable state. Numbers inside free-object subtrees get the same
  rule (the generic machine never buffers a spelling, so the schema wrapper
  now mirrors it), which also caps free-subtree numbers at the same 95-byte
  spelling limit schema numbers have always had. The closer's INVENTED
  minimum obeys the predicate too: `exclusiveMinimum:0` compiles to a
  clamped edge of 4.94e-324 - the smallest subnormal, in bounds by
  construction, ERANGE at read-back - and force-closing a bounded number
  or a minItems array fill used to emit it verbatim; the fill now scans
  for the smallest spelling that both parses and satisfies the bounds.
- **JSON mode refuses ill-formed UTF-8 the way the parser does.** The
  generic machine took any string byte >= 0x20 as content, so a lone
  continuation byte, an overlong lead, or an 0xF5.. lead flowed into
  documents json_parse rejects - in plain --json output and in every
  free-object subtree of a tool schema. Both validators now share the
  sequence classifier (json_utf8_byte) the schema strings already used, and
  the json-mode closer finishes a truncated scalar before writing its
  closing quote instead of emitting a document that cannot parse.
- **Duplicate object keys are refused the way the parser refuses them.**
  json_parse rejects a repeated key AFTER unescaping, and three generation
  paths disagreed with it: plain JSON mode (and every free-object subtree
  of a tool schema) accepted duplicates outright; the schema map guard
  caught only same-spelling repeats, so `"a"` versus `"a"` slipped
  through; and both force-closers could complete a truncated key INTO a
  duplicate - the CI fuzzer's second run produced `{"a":1,"a":0}` from a
  map close, a document the runner's own tool-argument readback then
  refused. Both validators now share one duplicate guard that hashes
  DECODED key content (raw bytes, decoded escapes, surrogate pairs as
  their scalar), refusing the duplicate at its closing quote while every
  continuation stays legal, and both closers extend a force-closed key
  until it is unique instead of minting the collision. The guard's
  capacity FAILS CLOSED: it previously stopped tracking past its limit, so
  a 17th key could duplicate an earlier one unchecked - now the comma that
  would start an untrackable entry is refused (and the first key of an
  object opened at capacity), while `}` stays legal, so objects are
  bounded at 24 tracked keys across open depths, never wedged, and never
  carry an unchecked duplicate.
- **`/health` never reports current RSS above peak RSS.** On Linux the two
  readings come from different kernel counters (statm for current,
  ru_maxrss for peak) whose split-RSS accounting can lag each other, so a
  raw pair could show a peak below the present - a self-inconsistency in
  the number a supervisor budgets machines with. A current reading of X is
  itself evidence the peak is at least X, so the pair is clamped
  self-consistent at the moment it is reported.
- **The candidate-token oracle is now differentially tested, three ways.**
  A seeded walker (tests/test_sval_walk.c, in `make test`) probes all 256
  bytes at every step of random walks through legal document space,
  comparing the poisoned-scratch trial against a full struct copy - answers
  AND live state - and checks the closer's parse guarantee at every
  frontier; a differential fuzz target (fuzz_sval_trial) does the same
  under libFuzzer+ASan+UBSan in CI; and a `conformance-sanitized` CI job
  drives the full agent-protocol conformance harness against the
  ASan+UBSan binary, because the plain-build suite proved unable to
  surface undefined behavior. Between them they found every disagreement
  above, most within seconds of existing - including one on the sanitized
  leg's very first run.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-08-28

- **Transcript metadata is always valid JSON.** Runner, compiler, OS,
  architecture and GPU-device strings now use the same JSON escaping path as
  model paths and prompts. A driver-reported device name containing a quote or
  control byte previously produced an unparsable receipt. The transcript
  builder also detects size overflow and no longer truncates formatted fields
  at its 512-byte scratch buffer.
- **Tray config read errors no longer leak descriptors.** `cfg_load` now
  closes its stream independently of `ferror`. A config path replaced by a
  directory or failing special file could previously leak one descriptor on
  every menu refresh because the short-circuit skipped `fclose`, eventually
  starving the long-lived tray process.
- **T1 transcript verification now covers exact output bytes.** New records
  carry `output.bytes_hex` alongside the human-readable JSON text, and replay
  diffs both tokens and that raw byte stream. Tokenizer byte pieces can be
  invalid UTF-8 in isolation, so the JSON text alone was lossy; `--verify`
  previously reported VERIFIED after a chain-valid output-text forgery and
  could not enforce its documented bit-exact T1 promise. Capture allocation
  failures now also fail the receipt instead of silently writing truncated
  output. Legacy v1 records without the exact byte field retain token replay.
- **Transcript build identity survives PATH invocation.** Transcript creation
  and replay now hash the OS-resolved running image instead of `argv[0]`.
  Invoking `runner` by bare name from another directory previously recorded an
  empty binary hash and downgraded same-binary verification to T2; it now
  records the real hash and reports T1, or fails the record closed if the
  executable cannot be hashed.
- **Transcript replay rejects malformed values before they reach inference.**
  A correctly recomputed public chain hash is an integrity check, not an
  authorization boundary. `--verify` now applies the CLI's finite, range and
  integer rules to every recorded sampling value, bounds every prompt/output
  token id to the loaded vocabulary before replay, and reads records through
  the capped checked-file path. Previously fractional/overflowing integer
  fields were narrowed with undefined C conversions and invalid prompt ids
  could reach the engine; some malformed records could even report VERIFIED.
- **Transcript replay preserves every accepted RNG seed.** Transcript v1 now
  carries an exact decimal `config.seed_u64` alongside the numeric compatibility
  field, and `--verify` uses it instead of rounding through the JSON parser's
  double representation. Seed `2^53+1` previously replayed a different sampled
  stream and falsely reported inference divergence; it is now gated end to end.
  Legacy records remain replayable when their numeric seed is exactly
  representable, and an inexact wide legacy seed is `UNVERIFIABLE` rather than
  silently rounded.
- **Transcript profiles now describe and reproduce the run that actually
  happened.** A requested q8 KV mode that fell back to f16 was previously
  recorded as q8, and the default prompt batch was recorded as zero. Records
  now carry the effective KV type, batch size, worker count and GPU layer
  count. `--verify` applies those values plus the recorded LoRA scale, and
  returns `UNVERIFIABLE` if the runtime cannot reproduce them, instead of
  silently replaying under conflicting CLI or fallback settings.

- **Metal MoE prompt batching**: routed-MoE prompt processing batches
  normalization, routing and expert-slot work across the tile instead of
  dispatching per token per layer. Measured on a real routed MoE
  (Qwen3-30B-A3B pruned to 24 experts, M1, 729-token prompt): MoE-class
  dispatches 12,528 -> 288, prefill +2.9% with zero overlap across five
  interleaved A/B pairs, output tokens byte-exact and expert routes
  bit-identical to the serial path (gated). Honest mechanics: total
  dispatch count is roughly unchanged - the win comes from routing
  expert compute through the better-optimized matvec kernels, not from
  launch elimination; deeper expert-compute batching remains open.
  Runtime-toggleable (RUNNER_METAL_MOE_BATCH=0 restores the serial
  path). Implemented by an agent run whose real-model gate could not
  find a routed MoE that fits the target machine; the acceptance
  artifact is a 4.3 GB expert-pruned fixture built with --prune-experts,
  quality irrelevant and routing intact.

- **`--transcript F` (notarized inference D1)**: records a one-shot run
  as a replay-verifiable `xyntetik.runner.transcript.v1` document - model
  and binary sha256, verification profile, full config and seed, prompt
  and output token ids, and a chain hash covering every byte of the file
  before the `,"chain"` key (recomputable with a text editor and
  sha256sum). Same binary + same record replays bit-exact; cross-ISA
  replays token-exact per the D0 falsifier ladder.
- **`--verify F` (notarized inference D2)**: replays a transcript against
  the loaded model and diffs. Three verdicts, three exit codes:
  VERIFIED (0; tier T1 same-binary or T2 token-replay), DIVERGED at
  token N (2), UNVERIFIABLE (3: altered record, wrong model sha, wrong
  adapter). The record's profile and sampling config drive the replay,
  overriding CLI flags. The demo that matters: forge a record's token
  and recompute its chain hash, and the replay still catches it - you
  can forge the hash, not the model.

- **Legacy Completions rejects prompt controls it cannot honor.** A client
  requesting `echo:true` or a non-null `prompt_logprobs` previously received
  HTTP 200 and a response missing the requested prompt-side data, so scoring
  tooling aligned against an answer that was silently incomplete. Both now
  return a parameter-naming 400 until Runner can produce the prompt-side
  output; the neutral SDK forms (`echo:false`, `prompt_logprobs:null`) are
  still accepted. These controls are never ignored.
- **gemma4 tool calling falls back instead of refusing.** A `tools[]` schema
  the native gemma4 syntax cannot constrain (an untyped parameter, for
  example) previously returned 400 while the same request worked on gpt-oss.
  The native compiler now runs as a probe before rendering; an
  unconstrainable request keeps strict mode on the generic JSON envelope,
  prompt and grammar switching together, and the downgrade is announced on
  stderr, never silent.
- **Constrained output now agrees with its own schema.** Fixes across the
  schema engine, each previously able to emit a 200 whose document did not
  parse or did not match the request: `{"type":"integer"}` accepted leading
  zeros (`0999999` went out as JSON the runner's own parser refuses);
  `minimum` and `exclusiveMinimum` replaced instead of intersecting each
  other; `minItems`/`minLength` closer fills could eat the buffer and drop
  the closing bracket; closing inside a string escape overran `maxLength` by
  one; raw UTF-8 string lengths counted a byte per length unit while escapes
  counted code points, and a lead byte admitted at the boundary stranded its
  continuation bytes; a free-keyed object could emit the same key twice.
  Required whitespace (an exact `"\n"` position) also reported as content, so
  every whitespace-only token was masked while whitespace was the only legal
  byte.
- **Quantize can no longer report success over a file it did not change.**
  A `--type-plan` with a misspelled container key, a non-array `rules`, or an
  empty plan loaded as "keep everything", exited 0, and wrote the input back
  while the caller believed they had built a selective-precision artifact;
  the container is now as strict as the rules, and a plan selecting nothing
  is refused by name. `--quant` alongside `--type-plan` (never read) is now
  refused. Same-width declines (`q4_0`->`q4_K`, `q5_0`->`q5_K`) are counted
  and reported instead of silent. `--merge-lora` no longer lets a crafted
  adapter tensor name land two tensors in one (projection, side) slot.
  Quantizing from a split GGUF no longer copies the source's `split.*` keys
  into the single-file output (which made the artifact unreadable everywhere,
  ours and llama.cpp alike). Outputs are forced to stable storage before the
  rename that publishes them. A crafted 4-D per-expert tensor can no longer
  be silently under-written to a zero-padded stub.
- **Four hostile-GGUF gaps closed on the load path.** The special-token sort
  was quadratic in a count the file controls (minutes of parked slot at
  vocabulary sizes a real download can carry; now qsort with a stable-order
  tiebreak). qwen35's Gated DeltaNet gate gains the range ceilings its
  sibling gates always had (signed overflow made a shape check vacuous). An
  `expert_shared_feed_forward_length` of `0x80000000` read as INT_MIN and
  silently dropped the always-on shared expert, the model answering as a
  different architecture; it is now refused. `general.architecture` and
  string-array elements are no longer trusted raw: refusal messages print a
  bounded printable copy instead of attacker bytes, and embedded NULs in
  tokenizer token arrays are rejected.
- **A recurrent model never reuses a truncated prefix snapshot.** The prefix
  cache's half-budget clamp stored the leading tokens of an oversized entry,
  which is valid for attention rows but pairs them with a recurrent fold
  state the prompt does not reach until later; a qwen35 / granite-hybrid /
  nemotron-h server with prompts large against `RUNNER_PREFIX_CACHE_MB`
  returned wrong tokens with nothing on the wire saying so. The clamp now
  drops the entry instead; storing nothing costs a prefill.
- **Server ledger and error-path honesty.** A VRAM claim that cannot be
  recorded is no longer admitted (an unwritten entry was invisible bytes
  every later decision over-committed). `/v1/models` escape buffers are
  sized to the true worst case instead of truncating operator names
  mid-escape. Candidate ordering is total under NaN logits instead of
  qsort undefined behavior.
- **Python client: unverifiable startup leases age out; stream timeouts
  split.** An ownership claim that can be neither proven nor disproven is
  honored only while its lease file is fresh and taken over after
  `RUNNER_UNVERIFIED_LEASE_TTL` (default 900 s); verifiable ownership never
  ages. Stream timeouts split first-byte from stall on content rather than
  connection, so the long legitimate silence of a big prompt's prefill
  (after the role-only delta, before the first content frame) runs on the
  generous first-byte bound and the documented stall window governs after
  content. The lease probe also pins `LC_ALL` and `TZ`, so a shell in
  another timezone or locale no longer reads a live owner's start time as a
  pid reuse and steals its lease.
- **Python client: opt-in update check.** Notify-only and never implicit: an
  explicit opt-in asks GitHub for the latest release tag and prints a notice;
  nothing is downloaded and nothing runs on by default.
- **Published-claim scripts fail loudly and measure what they publish.**
  `idle_coexistence` stamped time-to-first-token on the role-only delta
  (connection setup, near zero for any model) and now stamps the first
  content frame, measures the process tree (ollama and vLLM fork their
  weight-holder), and keeps server logs out of the report JSON.
  `competitor-freshness` exited 0 when every registry lookup failed; a run
  that compared nothing now exits 2. `make-test-model.py` no longer turns a
  misspelled option into the output filename. The release gate's
  stale-version scan matched nothing after v0.2.0 retired the `-alpha`
  suffix (three of its checks were vacuous) and now matches the spellings
  this project actually uses.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-25

The merge release — and the one where the training loop got fast enough
to matter. `--merge-lora` folds a trained adapter into its base as a
standalone GGUF for any runtime, with the measured warning that motivated
it: merging into a 4-bit base can silently erase the fine-tune (the study
that proved it is on HF). The backward was position-batched under the
byte-exact contract for a 2.3x training speedup with adapter bytes gated
identical across binaries, thread counts and the new opt-in CUDA assist.
Adapter interop was measured in both directions, F16 community adapters
now load, and provenance records grew build identity after an independent
external reproduction (thanks!) showed exactly where artifact determinism
ends. Plus 28 hardening commits from an external review: atomic saves,
stricter validation, Windows portability.


- **Provenance carries build identity**: `.train.json` records the
  running binary's sha256, compiler, OS and arch — so reproduction
  reports can distinguish "same executable" from "same source". Prompted
  by an independent external reproduction (which also confirmed adapter
  byte-equality on a Tesla T4, a third GPU generation): a rebuild under a
  different ISA profile changes the bytes via libm's `expf`, so the
  determinism contract is explicitly artifact-level + behavioral, and the
  docs now say so (three-level taxonomy, credited).

- **D8 slice 3 — position-batched backward, 2.3× on the CPU** (47 →
  20.5 s/step at 4B, 96 threads): every projection site runs as one
  batched transposed matvec over the training window; workers partition
  by (column-slice × position-chunk); the attention backward threads
  over kv-head groups; the lm-head backward chunks. All of it is
  scheduling under a byte-exact contract — adapters are byte-identical
  across the old binary, the new binary, any thread count, and the GPU
  assist (gated, incl. at 4B). RUNNER_TRAIN_PROF=1 prints per-step phase
  wall times. The GPU assist now loses on kernel occupancy (device grid
  covers n_in only) — the remaining, deprioritized GPU slice is a
  kernel-side batch grid.

- **D8 slice 2 — persistent-weight GPU backward** (`RUNNER_TRAIN_GPU=1`):
  --train can route its dominant backward matvec through CUDA with each
  weight uploaded once and cached; per-tensor CPU fallback is free because
  both paths are gated byte-identical. Verified at 4B scale on a second
  GPU generation (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell after the slice-1 RTX 3070):
  byte-identical adapters, identical loss curves. Measured honestly: it
  does not yet beat 96 CPU threads (47 s vs 72 s per 4B step, 1g MIG
  slice) — batch-1 transfer/sync overhead dominates; batching the
  backward across positions is the next slice.
- **F16/BF16 adapters accepted** by `--lora` and `--merge-lora` (the
  format llama.cpp's `convert_lora_to_gguf` emits — found by loading a
  real community adapter, which the F32-only check refused). Interop now
  measured both ways: runner's adapter scores 1.000 served by stock
  llama.cpp; the community F16 adapter loads, serves and measurably
  shifts `--score` in runner.
- **Merge-survival scale sweep** (docs/adaptation-engine.md D9): merged
  into Q4_K_M, the ToolUse adapter's behavior is erased through 2× scale,
  partial at 4×, fully survives at 8× — where the exact 8× adapter breaks
  the served model (0.138) and the 4-bit grid filters it back to 1.000.
  Quantization is a filter on your fine-tune with a pass-band you don't
  control; eval the artifact you ship.

- **`--merge-lora OUT`** (adaptation D9): fold a `--lora` adapter into the
  base weights and write a standalone GGUF that runs in any GGUF runtime,
  each tensor requantized to its own type or to `--quant T`, untouched
  tensors copied byte-verbatim, `OUT.merge.json` provenance (base/adapter/
  merged sha256s + config) beside it. Deterministic: same inputs, byte-
  identical merged file; on an F32 base the merged floats are gated
  byte-exactly against the documented fmaf chain. Hostile adapters (wrong
  shape, half a pair, unhooked projection, wrong architecture) refuse the
  whole merge. Merging into a quantized type rounds the delta through that
  type's grid — measured per artifact, never assumed; `base + --lora`
  remains the exact form. Measured at 4B scale on the published ToolUse
  artifact: merging into Q8_0/F16 preserves the trained behavior at 1.000
  exact-call (verified end-to-end in stock llama.cpp b10581); merging back
  into the Q4_K_M base **erases the fine-tune** — the merged file scores
  the base's 0.690, with 98.55% of weight bytes rounded back to the base's
  codes. Merge determinism held at 4B: two runs, byte-identical 2.5 GB
  files. Full numbers: docs/adaptation-engine.md D9.
- **Q4_K, Q6_K and BF16 quantize writers** (faithful ggml ports, gated on
  round-trip error through the production dequant readers and on byte
  determinism): `--quantize`, `--quant` and `--type-plan` now accept
  `q3_k`, `q4_k`, `q6_k`, `f16`, `bf16` and `keep` everywhere a target
  type is named.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-21

The adaptation release — and the release that drops the `-alpha` suffix. The
binary that serves a model can now score it, load adapters for it, and train
it, deterministically, through the same quantized weights it serves. Plus a
round of CUDA work that retired two long-standing performance pathologies,
request cancellation, and a batch of correctness fixes from an external
review series.

### The adaptation engine (`--score`, `--lora`, `--train`)

- **`--score`**: teacher-forced per-token logprobs/NLL/perplexity over raw
  text as versioned JSON. Defaults to the solo forward path — measured: the
  CPU batched forward is not bit-identical to solo (~1e-6), and the score
  should be the sampler's numerics; the faster chunked pass is opt-in with a
  test-pinned envelope.
- **`--lora`**: LoRA adapter GGUFs (llama.cpp naming) applied beside the
  untouched base matvecs on the CPU dense projections. Zero adapter is gated
  byte-identical to the bare base; a real adapter is gated against the
  merged-weights reference. The adapter id joins the engine's model
  identity, so cached prefixes never cross an adapter boundary.
- **The backward pass**: full activation-gradient reverse sweep (attention
  with cross-position dK/dV, rope adjoint, per-head QK-norm adjoint, rmsnorm
  backward) with weight gradients only for adapters; frozen-base gradients
  flow through a transposed quantized matvec (any decodable weight type,
  FD-verified through real Q8_0 rows). Finite-difference gates across every
  projection slot on three fixture families; a sabotaged rope adjoint fails
  the gate at relative error 1.36.
- **`--train`**: AdamW LoRA training with adapter-GGUF checkpoints, plain-
  text and JSONL (prompt-masked, weighted) data modes, and a provenance
  record (`<adapter>.train.json`: base/data/adapter sha256s, seed, config)
  beside every adapter. **Deterministic training is a gated property**: same
  data + same seed produce a byte-identical adapter file. Measured at scale:
  Llama-3.2-3B Q4_K_M trains through its frozen 4-bit base at ~33 s/step on
  32 CPU threads (exact-corpus nll 5.00 → 0.31).
- **GRPO-lite** (`scripts/train-grpo-lite.py`): seeded sampling from the
  runner itself + group-normalized clipped advantages + weighted `--train`
  passes. Both measured runs are documented, including the raw-advantage
  policy collapse. `scripts/make-tooluse-data.py` + `scripts/eval-tooluse.py`
  provide a deterministic tool-calling dataset and eval.
- Full design + measurements: `docs/adaptation-engine.md`. CPU path v1; CUDA
  training is future work. Scope is fail-closed by property (dense SiLU
  transformers incl. QK-norm families; recurrent/MoE refuse by name).

### CUDA

- **The Mamba-2 device path had never actually run** — two silent
  validation bugs pushed every hybrid to CPU behind a full-offload banner.
  Fixed and certified: `nemotron_h` and dense granitehybrid now fully
  offload token-identically (h-micro 11.9 → 114.5 tok/s;
  `docs/compat-reports/cpu-cuda-hybrid-2026-08-21/`).
- **Q3_K prefill GEMM**: the measured 6.7–15.5× prompt-processing pathology
  is retired — `k_gemm_q3_K` lands at 6.6× measured prefill speedup on the
  reference model, byte-identical across `-b 512/64/1` and the CPU path.
- **qwen35 promoted to the tensor-core arch list** on four measured gate
  rows (two checkpoints × two types, all 0/64 flips).
- The decode microbatch now declines recurrent and NoPE-stepped families
  explicitly, and Apertus's ungated FFN, before touching NULL weights.

### Engine and server

- **Request cancellation**: an engine stop predicate polled between prefill
  chunks and decode steps, wired to socket-close detection (an orderly FIN
  cancels; quiet or pipelined connections never do). An abandoned prefill
  now stops within one chunk.
- Sparse-MoE thread default capped at the measured knee (32) on many-core
  hosts; pinned `-t` never overridden.
- granitehybrid dense variant (h-micro) no longer segfaults: the recurrent-
  layer MLP binds on dense h-models.
- `nemotron_h_moe` loads coverage-pruned files (per-layer expert counts).
- Anthropic API: malformed `system` blocks now return a 400; conformance
  tests follow the SDK v1.0 sampling migration.
- Native tool protocols (gemma4, muse) no longer force optional parameters:
  a shared optional-member construct landed in the constrained-decoding
  validator. Apertus tool turns render byte-conformant to the reference.
- Grammar fast-forward measured net-negative on sparse-MoE wall-clock and
  stays opt-in; teacher-forced scoring documents why.

## v0.1.20-alpha — 2026-08-20

A feature release on top of the review release: a new model family (Mamba-2
hybrids), a certified-envelope gate that ships a model's measured limits beside
it and refuses the ones that should not run, two more formats on CUDA, and a
container image. Grouped by theme.

### New architectures — Mamba-2 hybrids (granitehybrid, nemotron_h)

- **Granite-4 and Nemotron-Nano hybrid SSM models now load and run.** The
  engine gained a full Mamba-2 selective-scan path alongside attention: decode
  (the per-token recurrence), a grouped scan for `nemotron_h`, and a
  chunked-scan prefill so a prompt is consumed in blocks rather than one token
  at a time. The recurrent state is snapshotted and restored across the cache
  seam, so rewind/continuation and the server's context reuse work the same as
  they do for a pure-attention model. Decode was re-verified math-correct at
  Q8_0 on granitehybrid. Before this, these architectures were refused at load;
  now an unknown Mamba-2 variant is still refused with a specific reason rather
  than mis-run. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 Q8_0 is published as an artifact (below).

### Backends and packaging

- **BF16 and Q2_K now run on CUDA — and the GPU minimum driver rises to
  CUDA 13.0 (R580 series).** `k_mv_bf16` and `k_mv_q2_K` (plus their batch
  twins) close the last two gaps between the CPU and CUDA format lists, so
  `--caps` now reports the full CPU list under `gpu_quants` on CUDA and
  BF16/Q2_K models offload instead of silently staying on CPU. Verified
  CPU==GPU token-identical on a real Q2_K artifact and a BF16 fixture.
  **Breaking for old drivers:** the embedded PTX is now generated by the
  CUDA 13.0 toolchain (PTX ISA 9.0; previously CUDA 13.3-built, and before
  that the ~11.8-era floor). A driver older than CUDA 13.0 (R580) cannot
  JIT the embedded kernels; the runner prints the JIT failure and falls
  back to CPU — if the GPU "suddenly stopped working" after this change,
  update the NVIDIA driver to a CUDA 13.0-capable one (`nvidia-smi` shows
  the driver's CUDA level, top right). See README "Install" and
  "Execution and backends".

- **A CPU container image ships with each release.** The same binary on a
  distroless glibc base — `docker build -t runner .`, or pull
  `ghcr.io/joakimpalm-zen/xyntetik-runner:<version>` / `:latest`; the release
  workflow builds and pushes it (private until made public). The server binds
  loopback only by design, so serve with `--network host` on Linux (reachable
  on the host's `127.0.0.1` only, never the network); `-p` does not work. CPU by
  default, and GPU-capable with `--gpus all` on an NVIDIA host without a separate
  image (the binary loads the CUDA driver at runtime and carries embedded PTX,
  so no CUDA toolkit is baked in) — verified on an RTX 3070 via WSL2 (2026-08-19,
  Docker 29.1.3 + NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.19.1): the same image with
  `--gpus all` reports `gpu.backend "cuda"` and offloads to VRAM, without the
  flag it reports `gpu null` and runs on CPU. See the README "Container image"
  section.

### The certified-envelope gate

- **A model can now ship its measured limits in a sidecar, and the runner
  enforces them.** `<model>.envelope.json` is an index over evidence that
  already exists — `scripts/certify-envelope.py` reads `runner --caps` for the
  runtime identity, an optional compat report for the per-model quality/load
  evidence, and the artifact's own sha, and emits one JSON sidecar; absent
  evidence is recorded as `null`, never invented. At load the runner reads a
  sibling manifest, matches it to its own `(version, backend)`, and reports the
  state. The three enforced verdicts are sharpened by epistemic status:
  **certified** (every gate passed against a named reference sha — loads with a
  banner), **experimental** (loads and runs but a stricter gate fails, or there
  is no reference/evidence — loads with a banner, never refused), and
  **outside-envelope** (a measured reason says it should not run — the model
  won't load, or a check is an explicit refusal — the runner refuses it, past
  `--force-uncertified`). Load-time states are split five ways internally
  (unclassified/certified/outside/experimental/indeterminate). On the swap path
  a server refuses an outside-envelope model per request with HTTP 409 and keeps
  serving the others, rather than exiting. The flagship selective-precision 30B
  ships a real, measured manifest.
- **Fixed a latent bug that made every real manifest resolve as foreign.** The
  load-time check compared the manifest's runtime version against the
  `runner X` display string, but the certifier writes the bare `--caps` version
  (`0.1.20-alpha`); the two never matched, so a correctly-certified model was
  silently treated as unclassified. It now compares the bare version, the form
  both sides actually use.

### MoE certification

- **The CPU/CUDA byte-identity gate tolerates routing near-ties on MoE models,
  and only MoE models.** A sparse mixture-of-experts model can pick a different
  expert on CPU vs CUDA when two experts' router logits fall inside bar-v2's
  0.5-nat tie band — a sub-noise-floor flip, not a defect — which made a
  perfectly good MoE fail a strict byte-for-byte comparison. The gate now
  reports `pass_margin_qualified` and surfaces the exception detail
  (`N/M exact, K near-tie tolerated`) so a certificate never presents a clean
  identity it did not measure. Dense models get no tolerance (fail-closed,
  dense-strict). Measured against the flagship 30B, whose divergence was a
  single layer-14 router flip: it is correctly held at `experimental`, not
  waved through.

### Correctness

- **The offline quantizer now produces canonical, ggml-exact Q8_0 and q4_0
  output.** `-ffast-math` with flush-to-zero was rounding block scales
  differently from the reference, so a runner-quantized Q8_0/q4_0 file differed
  bit-for-bit from the ggml one for the same input. The quantization path is
  pinned so the bytes match exactly.

### Templates and tool protocol

- **gemma-4 mainline renders per checkpoint,** with the pre-seeded thought
  block the mainline chat template expects.
- **The five mutually-exclusive tool-protocol flags collapse into one enum,** so
  an impossible combination can no longer be requested.

### Measurement, benchmarks, and docs

- **A truncation-recovery benchmark across six engines.** `make test-truncation`
  gates a probe that measures how each engine behaves when generation is cut off
  mid-structure; the README carries the six-engine table (runner, llama.cpp
  b10488, Ollama 0.32.14, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, vLLM) in its own `#truncation`
  section, and `docs/truncation-benchmark.md` has the recipe and the committed
  granite head-to-head.
- **The quant-fidelity ladder is prescriptive, not just a decay report** — it
  states which format to use where, rather than only reporting the drop.
- **Metal `ah` scores-buffer traffic measured at 7.5% of KV** (not the 28% a
  back-of-envelope suggested), settling whether it was worth eliminating.
- **Compatibility evidence refreshed:** Lucie re-pinned to the upstream-fixed
  GGUF with fresh tokenizer evidence (259 -> 190/721), competitor torture rows
  refreshed to current upstream (issue #9), and the agent-torture harness reports
  the tool-decline arm separately (schema v4).
- **A soak harness for the startup/SIGTERM race** (`make repro-startup-signal`).
- **Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 Q8_0 GGUF** added to the published artifacts list.

## v0.1.19-alpha — 2026-08-19

The largest release since the last public alpha: a module-by-module review of the
whole engine, and the tree it left behind. Performance first, then the heap of
correctness and bug fixes, then the behaviour changes.

### Performance

- **CPU decode on aarch64 is 2.2x to 6.8x faster on the formats that were
  slow.** `quants.c` is pinned to `-fno-fast-math`, which silently
  un-vectorized the four dot kernels left to the compiler (F16, BF16, Q8_0,
  Q4_K) and the generic dequant-then-dot fallback the sub-4-bit formats use;
  Q2_K/Q3_K still decoded a block one value at a time, and q4_0 — the default
  requant target — had no NEON block dequant at all. Measured end to end,
  `--gpu off`, decode tok/s: SmolLM2-135M F16 28.7 -> 104.7, Q8_0 38.5 ->
  104.5, gemma-3-4b Q4_K_M 2.9 -> 6.4, tinyllama Q2_K 2.80 -> 19.0. Prefill
  gains separately from an F16 dequant that no longer walks a 256 KB lookup
  table per weight (+8.6%) and from NEON q4_0/IQ4 dequant. Greedy output is
  byte-identical on every model checked; the two reassociated reductions are
  tolerance-gated rather than bit-exact and moved no tokens.

- **Tokenizing is no longer quadratic in the special-token list.** The scan
  probed every special token at every input byte; gemma-3 marks 6,414 tokens
  special, so 4,000 characters of prose cost 25.6M comparisons. Grouping by
  first byte removes work, not candidates: gemma-3-4b 57.31 ms -> 1.64 ms,
  granite-4.1 1.10 -> 0.22, SmolLM2 0.81 -> 0.24. Token ids are byte-identical
  across the committed 721-string corpus and a generated corpus of every
  special token of seven vocabularies.

- **Constrained decoding is faster: +15% on a schema, +17% in `--json`
  mode.** Testing one candidate token copied the whole engine, and the
  validator underneath it a second time — 7,136 bytes per candidate, per
  vocabulary entry when `top_k` is off, which is the shipped preset for eight
  families. Profiling put 1,644 of 5,985 decode samples in `memmove` against
  249 in the validator. The validators now expose a trial API carrying only
  live state. Output is byte-identical on greedy and seeded sampled runs.

- **The CUDA decode microbatch is bit-identical to sequential decode on
  quantized models again** (it had been silently divergent since 2026-07-28),
  **and the batch gate now runs on a quantized fixture.** A batched step owes
  each sequence the bits a lone step would have produced — that is what lets a
  sequence leave a microbatch and continue solo — and on every quantized model
  it stopped delivering them when the decode GEMVs were rewritten and their
  multi-column twins were not. Sampled tokens matched throughout; the
  divergence was in the last mantissa bits. Q4_0, which had been refused
  outright since 2026-08-18 because it had no twin at all, batches again at
  1.62x (Qwen3-0.6B-q4_0, N=4) instead of decoding sequentially at 1.07x. The
  batching win is otherwise unchanged — Q8_0 1.84x -> 1.92x, Q4_K 1.57x ->
  1.54x, Q5_K 1.50x -> 1.69x, Q6_K 2.04x -> 1.98x at N=4 — so identity cost
  nothing. `make test` runs the batch gate on a Q8_0 fixture as well as the F32
  one, because the F32 fixture cannot reach a quantized matvec and so could
  never have caught this.

### Correctness and bug fixes

- **Files written on x86 change bytes.** The portable `f32->f16` conversion
  rounded ties AWAY from zero; aarch64 converts with `fcvt`, which rounds ties
  to even, and so do llama.cpp and ggml. 16,808,958 of the 2^32 float bit
  patterns came out different between the two builds, and that function writes
  every q8_0 block scale, every f16 KV entry and every scale and weight the
  requantizer emits — so an f16 requant of the same input was a different FILE
  on x86 than on ARM, and the KV cache was byte-different for the same prompt
  on two machines. It also turned NaN into Inf. Now ties-to-even everywhere,
  verified by an exhaustive sweep of all 2^32 inputs against the hardware
  instruction: zero differences, NaN payloads included. aarch64 output is
  unchanged; x86 and other fallback builds now agree with it.

- **gpt-oss on CUDA was routed without its router bias.** The fused MoE path —
  the default for every gpt-oss model on CUDA — passed `0` where the CPU,
  Metal and the other two CUDA paths pass `ffn_gate_inp.bias`, so the router
  softmaxed raw logits and at realistic top-k *selected* experts the CPU would
  not have. Fixed and gated with a top-1 MoE fixture, where the bias decides
  which expert runs. This does not make gpt-oss CPU/CUDA identical: on
  gpt-oss-120b the divergence went 0.00946 -> 0.00245 of logit range against a
  2e-3 bound, so at least one more difference remains
  ([docs/cuda-gptoss-router-bias-2026-08-18.md](docs/cuda-gptoss-router-bias-2026-08-18.md)).

- **The "one more difference" turned out to be the model, not the backend — no
  kernel change.** With `gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4` now on the Blackwell box, the CUDA
  divergence was bisected (2026-08-19). It is not a wrong op: at **full offload**
  gpt-oss-20b passes `test-gpu-identity` at 0.000732 of range, and the bound is
  exceeded only under partial offload (0.00356 at 1 GPU layer), where one device
  layer's reduction-order rounding is amplified through the remaining CPU
  layers — a divergence that is *non-monotonic* in GPU-layer count, which a
  systematic wrong op cannot be. A routing trace shows the mechanism directly: a
  single sub-ULP perturbation reorders two top-4 experts tied to four decimals,
  the same discrete-routing chaos already documented for gemma-4-26b-a4b. The
  model disagrees with itself on 3/16 prompts under a CPU-only KV-precision
  change, so the gap is inside its own sensitivity floor. All three candidates
  the router-bias note named (MXFP4 dequant, attention-sink softmax, per-expert
  bias fold) are algebraically identical CPU↔CUDA. gpt-oss-120b at 4 GPU layers
  reproduces 0.00245 as the same effect at greater amplification depth (it
  cannot be fully offloaded on a 24 GB MIG).
  ([docs/cuda-gptoss-divergence-2026-08-19.md](docs/cuda-gptoss-divergence-2026-08-19.md)).

- **CUDA: a dense model quantized Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q3_K, IQ4_NL, IQ4_XS or
  MXFP4 no longer joins a decode microbatch.** Those types have no decode GEMV,
  and the tile kernel the microbatch fell back to is not their batch-1 kernel's
  twin either — it factors the block scale into each weight where the batch-1
  kernel keeps it outside the block sum, which is the same value in a different
  association. Such a model now decodes its sequences one at a time rather than
  batching them into different numbers; `batch_steps`/`batch_sequences` stay 0
  for it. Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, F32 and F16 batch as before.

- **Metal: a session whose every batch is one token decoded garbage.** The
  chunked decode attention's partial buffers were allocated only on the
  multi-token path, so a run that never prefills more than one token bound them
  nil and, past the chunk threshold, produced silent nonsense on the shipped
  default configuration. Reproduced at `-b 1`; a one-token prompt and the
  single-token forward before a prefix-cache load reach the same state.

- **Metal: a split (multi-part) GGUF is now declined instead of computed
  wrong.** Weight bindings are offsets into the first part's mapping, so
  tensors in later parts were unresolvable; the backend printed "results from
  this model are not trustworthy" and ran anyway. It now fails closed at load
  and the model runs on the CPU.

- **A hostile GGUF is refused at load rather than trusted.** The worst of them:
  `bos_token_id` (and eos/unk) went from the file into the token stream with
  nothing checked against `n_vocab`, and the repeat penalty is a
  read-modify-write at that index — a crafted file got a controlled
  out-of-bounds WRITE at an offset it chose (ASan: heap-buffer-overflow 10,240
  bytes past a 1,024-byte region). Also now refused or bounded: a `block_count`
  that arrives negative as an int and asks calloc for ~2^64 bytes, per-layer
  head dims and training contexts above the geometry ceiling, expert and
  shared-expert FFN widths that outrun their buffers, a gemma-4 rope dim wider
  than its head, a sliding layer with no window, an undecodable tensor type
  parking a raw file offset in `data`, a duplicate-name check that switched
  itself off under memory pressure, and packed-array metadata read at the
  wrong stride. `make debug` (ASan/UBSan) is clean on the fixtures.

- **A nested-array tool schema can no longer take the process's memory.**
  gemma-4 array compilation replicates the element grammar per admissible
  position, so nesting multiplies: measured 379 MB at four levels, 2.79 GB at
  five, and about 160 GB at the six the depth limit admitted. `tools[]` is
  request data, so that was an availability bug; the compiler is now bounded.

- **The MoE router is no longer quantized with the experts.** `--quant q4_0` on
  a MoE checkpoint rewrote `ffn_gate_inp.weight` at 4 bits; a perturbation
  there does not shift an activation, it selects a different expert and swaps a
  whole FFN. Routers keep their on-disk type on every path (whole-file target,
  a matching `--type-plan` rule, and pruning), which is what llama.cpp does and
  what the reference artifacts ship. They are ~0.3% of a 30B-A3B file.

- **A multi-tool-call turn no longer vanishes on `/v1/responses` and
  `/v1/messages`.** Both surfaces derived their single call by parsing the
  comma-separated call entries without the brackets that make them an array,
  which returns NULL — so a two-call turn arrived as an empty text block with
  `stop_reason: "tool_use"`: the surface telling a client a tool was called and
  handing it nothing to execute. Chat Completions was correct throughout, so
  the three dialects disagreed about the same turn. Single-call output is
  byte-identical.

- **Tool-history replay on `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages` now uses the
  resident model's native tool protocol, matching `/v1/chat/completions`
  byte-for-byte.** Both typed surfaces hard-coded the generic
  `<|tool_call>call:NAME{json}<tool_call|>` when replaying a prior assistant
  call, and neither named a gemma-4/muse tool result nor wrapped an ornith one
  in `<tool_response>` — so the identical conversation, replayed, taught
  gemma-4, ornith, and muse a call syntax (and a result shape) they were never
  trained on, while Chat Completions replayed the native one. All three surfaces
  now route through the same serializer (`tool_history_render_for` /
  `assistant_calls_render` / `tool_result_wrap`); a gemma-4, ornith, muse, or
  Harmony call and its result render identically no matter which dialect carried
  the history in. Chat's own bytes are unchanged, and the equivalence is pinned
  by a per-family contract in `tests/test_tool_attribution.c`. (Fixed along the
  way: the `input` re-serialization double-evaluated a loop counter through the
  `sb_lit` macro.) Chat, chatml, and Harmony replay bytes were already correct
  and are unchanged.

- **Tool *declarations* on `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages` now use the
  model's native protocol too, matching `/v1/chat/completions`.** The
  declaration-side twin of the replay fix above: the typed surfaces did not set
  the family's native declaration flags, so a gemma-4 or muse model offered
  tools through Responses or Messages was taught its declaration format in the
  generic block rather than gemma-4's `<|tool>declaration:...<tool|>` or muse's
  atem schema — a format it was never trained on. A single `tool_decl_native`
  serializer now backs all three surfaces; gemma-4 and muse declaration bytes
  change on the typed surfaces, chatml (whose native declaration is the generic
  one) and Harmony are unchanged, and the cross-surface equivalence is pinned by
  a per-family contract in `tests/test_tool_attribution.c`.

- **`keep_alive: 0` gives back what `POST /unload` gives back.** It freed the
  resident model but left the draft loaded and every KV prefix snapshot
  resident — up to 512 MB by default — so the two spellings of "unload now"
  returned different amounts of memory. Both now run the same safe-point
  unload, which also stops it running with the request still counted active.

- Structured output, further correctness: a truncated tool call was completed
  with the WRONG tool's arguments; a nullable object could never be null; a
  force-closed bounded number could violate its own bounds; force-closing
  inside a `\u` escape produced unreadable JSON; a schema keyword written with
  the wrong JSON type was reinterpreted rather than rejected; a raw block's
  terminator was missed when its own prefix repeated; a half-surrogate followed
  by an escape decoded to invalid UTF-8; a gemma-4 marker that is not a tool
  call corrupted the answer.

- Server and API robustness: `/v1/capabilities` read a model a slot thread had
  just freed; a compact `/health` request was answered with an RST instead of
  the answer; an allocation failure could drop a turn and still answer 200, or
  build an out-of-memory refusal from uninitialised stack; an abandoned
  generation step did not give its KV row back; every CLI error path leaked the
  model, tokenizer and engine.

### Behaviour changes

- **BREAKING: `POST /unload` now refuses with `409` where it cannot unload.**
  A single model served with `--parallel N` for `N > 1` never joins the model
  registry — its slots hold the model directly — so the endpoint freed the
  prefix cache, left every byte of weights and KV resident, and answered
  `{"status":"ok"}`. An operator reclaiming memory was told the model was gone
  and had no way on the wire to find out otherwise. The refusal names the
  configuration and points at `POST /v1/runner/prefix-cache/clear` and at
  `--parallel 1`. `409` because the request is well-formed and the route
  exists; what refuses it is server state that will not change on a retry.
  Every other configuration is unaffected: single-model `--parallel 1` and
  swap sets both join the registry and unload as before. Scripts that treat a
  non-2xx from `/unload` as fatal will now fail on a multi-slot server where
  they previously passed while achieving nothing. Making that configuration
  genuinely unloadable is a separate, later feature.

- **BREAKING: a completion carrying `keep_alive` is now refused with `400`
  where it cannot be honored.** The same configuration that broke `/unload` —
  a single model on `--parallel N` for `N > 1`, with no registry — also had no
  swap-mode idle/unload machinery for `keep_alive` to drive, so the field was
  range-checked, accepted, and then silently dropped. A client sending
  `keep_alive: 0` ("unload after this request") was answered as if it had
  happened while the model stayed fully resident. It is now a `400` naming the
  configuration, with code `keep_alive_unsupported`, matching how the surface
  rejects other well-formed-but-unsatisfiable request fields (`timeout out of
  range`, unsupported field semantics). `400` rather than `/unload`'s `409`
  because this is a per-request field on a completion, not a management route
  whose target-resource state refuses it. A completion with **no** `keep_alive`
  field is the normal case and is entirely unaffected — only a request that
  explicitly asks for behavior the server cannot deliver is refused. On every
  registry-backed configuration (`--parallel 1`, swap sets) `keep_alive` works
  as before.

- **`--quant` and `--type-plan` require `--quantize`.** Both were read only
  inside the rewrite block, so a generating run accepted them, ignored them and
  exited 0 in silence — including `--type-plan` pointed at a file that does not
  exist. Refused now, as `--prune-experts` already was.

- **`-s 0` is refused instead of silently randomized.** Zero is the sampler
  xorshift's fixed point, and the old guard substituted the clock — so the one
  seed that reads as "make this reproducible" produced a different completion
  every run, with nothing on stderr. It is now an error naming the reason;
  every other seed is unchanged.

- **The adopted margin-qualified top-1 criterion is tighter, and its report
  schema is now `xyntetik.runner.kld-raw.v3`.** `scripts/kld-compare-raw.py`
  forgave a top-1 divergence whenever the REFERENCE's own #1 and #2 were within
  the 0.5-nat tie band — a question that never mentions what the variant
  picked, so a near-tie at the top of the reference forgave every flip beneath
  it, including a variant confidently emitting a token the reference rates at
  e^-12. The band is now measured from the reference's best logprob to the
  token the variant actually picked, and a pick the reference never reported no
  longer qualifies. Plain top-1, KLD and top-8 overlap are untouched. Numbers
  published under the v2 rule were measured under the looser criterion and are
  not comparable with a v3 figure without a re-run; per-position records in
  existing v2 reports do not carry the new `pick_margin`, so a re-score off the
  old evidence is not possible either.

### Observability and tooling

- **`/health` publishes `batch_steps` and `batch_sequences`.** The scheduler
  had incremented them since continuous batching landed and nothing read them.
  Differenced by a consumer, they are the mean batch size over its own window —
  the one answer to "is batching earning its decode thread here" that timing
  requests from outside cannot give. Both stay 0 where no scheduler runs.

- Tooling under `scripts/`: fixes to gates that could not fail or could not
  see. Among them the compat ledger's timeout group-kill (which killed
  nothing), two ledger checks that certified whichever binary sat in the repo
  root, `token_divergence` reading top-k logprobs onto the wrong token ids,
  `quant-fidelity` computing its KLD in the opposite direction to its own
  bound, a torture leaderboard ranking on absolute pass count instead of pass
  rate, and a crashed runner being published as a model divergence.
  `scripts/check-generated.py` — the generated-GPU-header drift gate — now runs
  in CI, where it had never run.

## v0.1.18-alpha — 2026-08-15

- **Chat templates are now verified against each model's own template, not
  against runner's memory of it.** `scripts/template-conformance.py` renders a
  fixed conversation matrix through every family's upstream jinja and through
  runner's real C renderer, and diffs byte-exactly — at the token level too
  wherever the family's tokenizer is on the shelf. It replaced a set of
  goldens that had been written from runner's own output, and therefore proved
  self-consistency and nothing else; six of them were asserting runner's
  output as though it were the reference. The gate runs on macOS, Linux and
  Windows and carries a known-difference backlog that only shrinks. This
  release closes 6 llama-2 rows, 4 gemma-4, 3 ornith, 1 muse and 2 harmony,
  and adds cases (assistant turns carrying both text and tool calls) that made
  previously invisible differences measurable.
- **Llama-2 prompts were missing a token at every instruction boundary.** The
  reference emits `bos_token` on EVERY user turn, so a multi-turn conversation
  reads `</s><s>[INST]`; runner emitted only the leading one. It also never
  applied the reference's `content.strip()`, so an empty user turn rendered
  `<</SYS>>\n\n [/INST]` where the reference writes `<</SYS>> [/INST]`. Both
  fixed. A model whose template runner does NOT recognise now falls back to a
  distinct internal id rather than being treated as Llama-2 — it still renders
  the same markup, but it no longer receives Llama-2's BOS literal, which in a
  vocabulary without `<s>` as a special would have tokenized as three
  characters.
- **Mistral is three instruction framings, not one.** `mistral` (v0.3 and
  Mistral-Small-2409), `mistral-v1` (v0.1/v0.2) and `mistral-nemo`
  (Nemo-Instruct-2407) differ by a space beside each `[INST]`/`[/INST]` marker
  and by which user turn carries the system prompt. Runner previously rendered
  all of them through llama-2's path with the `<<SYS>>` block swapped out,
  producing a fourth framing that matches no Mistral checkpoint. Measured on
  Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3: `[INST] What is 2+2? [/INST]` is 11 tokens and
  `[INST] What is 2+2?[/INST]` is 10.
- **Sampling presets now follow the detected chat template, not the model
  name.** Both answer "which family is this", but the template is read out of
  the checkpoint while the name is a label a re-quantiser can change. A
  Mistral-Nemo export renamed without "nemo" in it was rendered with the Nemo
  template and sampled with the plain Mistral preset — temperature 0.7 where
  Nemo's own model card calls out 0.3.
- **ornith** now renders its tool-declaration prompt verbatim instead of
  paraphrasing it. The reference's example spans three lines to teach that a
  parameter may; runner's shortened `value_2` taught the opposite by omission,
  and the paraphrase dropped the rule that stops a tool-equipped model
  narrating its lack of tools at the user. Consecutive calls in one turn are
  also separated as the reference separates them, and the first call is framed
  on whether the turn carried visible text.
- **muse** tool turns now carry the call and nothing else, matching the
  reference's `to=NAME` recipient turn. This DISCARDS assistant text sent
  alongside tool calls in that turn: a recipient turn is muse's protocol for
  "I am calling this function", and prose in front of it is a shape the model
  was not trained on. Send the text as its own assistant turn if you want it
  in the conversation.
- **Thinking budgets have a documented contract.** With a constraint
  (`response_format` or `tools`) the thinking prelude is capped at half the
  token budget, and hitting that cap closes the prelude and spends the rest on
  the payload — `finish_reason` stays the standard `"length"` and
  `runner_telemetry.finish_detail` carries `"reasoning_limit"`. Without a
  constraint there is no cap. See the README section for why the two differ.
- **A tool result whose matching call has no function name no longer resolves
  worse than one with no match at all.** The lookup returned nothing on a
  nameless match, so the turn rendered under the template's `unknown`
  fallback, while an unmatched id at least came back as the id. It now keeps
  looking and falls through to the id.

- The chat-template conformance gate now runs on Windows, where it had never
  run at all: `scripts/template-conformance-render.c` included
  `<sys/socket.h>` and called `socketpair()`, neither of which MinGW-w64 has,
  so the driver failed to build and the gate covered two platforms while being
  described as covering three. The driver now takes its socket headers from
  `http.h` and opens a loopback pair on Windows. Behind that sat a second
  fault that would have produced FALSE DRIFT rather than a crash:
  `subprocess.run(capture_output=True, text=True)` returned `stdout is None`
  for the 31KB job payload (returncode 0, stderr intact) while bytes mode
  returned all 30604, and `text=True` decodes with the locale encoding — so on
  a non-UTF-8 machine a byte-exact gate would have diffed mojibake against a
  correct reference. Captures are bytes plus explicit UTF-8 now. macOS,
  Linux/CUDA and Windows/MinGW report the same 20 known differences.
- gemma4 tool requests now use the family's native protocol, and stay on the
  strict envelope while doing it. Declarations render as
  `<|tool>declaration:NAME{...}<tool|>` inside the caller's system turn (the
  reference's `format_function_declaration`, byte-exact), calls and results as
  `<|tool_call>call:NAME{k:v}<tool_call|>` / `<|tool_response>`. The obvious
  route to that syntax — dropping gemma4 off the strict path, as ornith is —
  was rejected: `env != NULL` is what buys constrained decoding, hence
  forced-truncation recovery, streamed tool-call deltas and `tool_choice`
  enforcement. The grammar changed instead, so a gemma4 call is constrained to
  declared names, declared argument keys and declared types, and `arguments`
  still reaches OpenAI clients as JSON rather than in gemma4's `<|"|>`
  spelling. Measured on gemma-4-E2B and gemma-4-31B: truncated calls at
  `max_tokens` 8/12/16 return parseable arguments with `finish_reason`
  `"length"`. Two limits are deliberate and documented in `src/schema.c` — an
  optional parameter is always emitted, and a parameter with no declared
  `type` is a 400 rather than a silently unconstrained value.
  gemma4's conformance backlog: 3 to 0.
- **Correction to the entry below (2026-08-14).** Its claim of conformance to
  the Harmony reference is narrower than stated. A first-ever conformance audit
  of every chat template against its upstream reference found that runner puts
  the `# Tools` namespace in the SYSTEM turn where the reference puts it in the
  DEVELOPER turn, never emits `Calls to these tools must go to the commentary
  channel: 'functions'.`, and makes `commentary` in `# Valid channels`
  conditional on tools where the reference always lists it. The golden that
  appeared to verify the placement was real openai-harmony output obtained
  through the builtin-tool slot instead of the function-tool slot, so it
  checked the namespace's contents and not its position. What WAS verified
  against the reference stands: the TypeScript type rendering, the
  `to=assistant` tool-result spelling, and the comment rules. The audit also
  found pre-existing drift in mistral, llama2, ornith and the ChatML families,
  none of it introduced by this work. Fixes and a conformance gate are in
  progress; `scripts/template-conformance.py` is the measurement.
- Prompt buffers are now measured rather than estimated. Every surface rendered
  the Harmony tool namespace into a buffer whose size predated it, and `emit()`
  truncates silently at its cap — dropping the TAIL, i.e. the newest user turn
  and the generation header. Measured on gpt-oss-20b: a 120-byte tool
  description made `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages` answer about London when
  asked about Oslo. `render_prompt_alloc` renders, checks whether the buffer
  came back full, and grows until it provably fit.
- A `stop` sequence no longer desynchronises constrained decoding. The
  validator consumed bytes the sink dropped, so the synthesized closer
  continued a document the client never received: `json_schema` + `stop`
  returned invalid JSON, the closer was itself stop-filtered (so `stop:["}"]`
  broke a `json_object` request even with no stop in the output), and the
  speculative walk skipped closing entirely. `stop` alongside a strict tool
  envelope is now a 400 rather than a silent downgrade.
- Harmony tool results are attributed or refused, never invented. An
  unresolvable id used to render `<|start|>tool` on two surfaces and a
  fabricated `functions.call_1` on the third.
- gpt-oss tool requests now use native OpenAI Harmony: official TypeScript
  tool declarations, channel-first commentary recipients, schema-constrained
  arguments, named/required/auto/none choices, response-format finals, native
  call/result history, and matching buffered/SSE mapping across Chat,
  Responses, and Anthropic Messages. A Blackwell gpt-oss-20b run produced the
  same `get_weather({"city":"Oslo","units":"celsius"})` action on all three
  surfaces and completed the returned-result turn without a second call for a
  prose tool result. A JSON tool result costs one redundant repeat call first,
  because the 192-byte analysis bound cuts the model mid-quotation; lifting
  that bound was measured as an unbounded loop and reverted
  (docs/negative-result-harmony-analysis-bound.md).
- Tokenizer differentials can now replay revision-bound Hugging Face reference
  ID captures without network access or credentials. The four outstanding
  divergent rows (Mistral-7B-v0.3, Phi-3.5-mini, Lucie-7B and Salamandra-7B)
  carry committed 721-string captures, and a fresh Blackwell build reproduced
  their established 44/2/259/16 divergence counts exactly.

## v0.1.17-alpha — 2026-08-13

Forty-seven commits since v0.1.16-alpha: two operator-facing capabilities,
the removal of Metal's single-buffer ceiling, a measured Metal prefill/decode
pass, broader tool-schema compatibility, quantizer work, and a cross-platform
hardening and certification sweep.

### Operator and API capabilities

- **`--fit` answers whether a GGUF will run before loading its weights.** A
  separate header-only parser reads metadata and tensor descriptors without
  weakening the normal loader's truncation checks. The report accounts for
  sparse-MoE hot sets and KV-cache upper bounds and returns `FITS`,
  `FITS WITH --kv q8`, or `PAGES`; a ranged header download can be checked
  without teaching Runner to fetch URLs.
- **`/health` now exposes process and work telemetry:** current and peak RSS,
  cumulative prompt/generated tokens, and cumulative generation seconds
  across every API surface. The counters are monotonic raw measurements so a
  supervisor can choose its own averaging window.
- Gemma-4 `enable_thinking:true` now emits the model's real thinking marker in
  the first system turn, including when the caller supplied no system text.

### Schema, tools, and client compatibility

- Anchored string patterns can contain serial fixed-length ASCII-class
  segments such as `^[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}$`; validation and forced completion use
  the same segment machine. Ambiguous variable-length middle segments remain
  rejected.
- Object schemas now accept `additionalProperties:false` without a
  `properties` member as the exact empty record, and homogeneous maps expressed
  with schema-valued `additionalProperties`. Arbitrary keys, typed values, and
  truncation completion are enforced; mixed fixed/open shapes still fail
  closed.
- The Python client enforces model-registry limits in UTF-8 bytes and rejects
  malformed streamed tool-call fragments and finish reasons while retaining
  partial output in protocol errors.
- Muse buffered mapping no longer searches beyond the supplied byte span and
  rejects malformed map inputs instead of relying on a trailing NUL.

### Metal performance and capacity

- **Weight files larger than `MTLDevice.maxBufferLength` are wrapped as
  several zero-copy, tensor-boundary buffers.** Full-offload admission budgets
  the aggregate mapping against the working set rather than clamping the whole
  model to one buffer. Forced 2/4/5-buffer gates are byte-identical and refuse
  unsplittable single tensors or excessive wrap counts loudly.
- QK/head norms and elementwise prefill work now batch across `grid.y`. The
  dispatch census at batch 64 fell from 15,947 to 827 (19.3x fewer), moving
  measured e2b-q40 prefill by **+3.55%** while preserving bit identity.
- Metal now applies Llama-4's position-dependent attention temperature on
  NoPE layers. A mutation-tested cross-backend logit gate detects its removal;
  its tolerance was recalibrated from Metal-only evidence to include honest
  CUDA reduction residue without approaching the smallest known real defect.
- **Metal decode attention is faster, and now tolerance-gated.** The
  cooperative KV read (one simdgroup per KV row, lanes splitting `head_dim`)
  is the default: **+3.0–4.3 %** decode at 2.3k–8.1k token spans. It clears
  zero top-1 flips out of 64 teacher-forced positions on every local model
  that reaches it, in both f16 and q8 KV formats. Because it reassociates the
  per-row dot, Metal decode at long context is no longer byte-identical to
  the CPU — `RUNNER_METAL_ATTN_COOP=0` pins the identical kernel back, and
  every CPU-vs-GPU byte comparison in the suite sets it.
- `RUNNER_METAL_STATS` reports per-pipeline threadgroup memory and a
  cooperative-dispatch count, a per-kind dispatch census, and decode KV bytes,
  so promotions and bottlenecks are measured rather than inferred.
- The accompanying negative results are retained as release evidence: a
  fourfold-leaner reassociating decode matvec measured neutral and stays off;
  GEMM tile/occupancy alternatives lost to the shipped 64x32x32 shape; and the
  long-context loss was isolated to a 1.52 GB/s KV read rather than missing
  attention parallelism.

### Quantization and correctness hardening

- Q4_0 repacking is lossless when a QAT source is already exactly on the Q4_0
  grid; the recovered candidate is accepted only if the shipped dequantizer
  reproduces every source float bit for bit. Non-grid inputs retain the prior
  derived-scale path.
- `--type-plan` can write selective Q3_K expert banks with exact round-trip and
  untouched-tensor byte identity. The finer fused-int8 activation experiment
  remains gated off after failing the promotion bar.
- A focused review removed the tray's remaining shell launch, released
  quantizer plans on every early exit, rejected invalid model-load arguments,
  made parser/cache bounds explicit, made C11 aggregate construction explicit,
  and labels unsupported HTTP methods correctly.
- Windows gates now use a native executable stub and force test-spawned MTP
  servers headless, eliminating the WinError 193 portability failure and the
  detached tray process that locked `runner.exe` during later relinks.

### Reproducibility and release evidence

- Compatibility reports are now a release gate. The manifest uses per-model
  reference revisions as its single truth and pins CPU/CUDA certification to
  the decided 128 generated tokens. A Blackwell ledger plus raw per-model CUDA
  evidence and a clean native Windows run are committed.
- `difftok.py` can capture a reference tokenizer once and replay its IDs
  offline, guarded by the exact corpus SHA-256.
- The contributor rules now cover the whole-second mtime trap in mutation and
  two-binary A/B builds: a restored source must be observably rebuilt, and the
  compared binaries must differ by a behavior the experiment should change.

## v0.1.16-alpha — 2026-08-12

Four days, three overnight measurement campaigns, and one external
evaluation's worth of findings. Grouped by what a user notices first.

### Correctness fixes, some of them shipped defects

- **Finer fused-int8 activation candidate, still gated off:** `I8A_QK` is 16
  instead of 32, with exact scalar/SIMD block identity retained. The two
  failing model rows re-gate at 1/64 and 2/64 top-1 flips, so this remains an
  opt-in measurement candidate and does not change the default.

- **CUDA tensor-core prefill for Q8_0/Q4_0 computed 16 of its 64 token
  columns** and published uninitialised shared memory as logits for the
  rest, on the DEFAULT path, since the 2026-07-29 batch widening. Found by
  measurement, fixed, and the gate that had passed the broken kernel was
  itself fixed: `test-tc-tol` now carries a free-running arm at a
  production context, verified to fail against the broken kernel. The
  cpu/cuda identity corpus now crosses the 16/32/64-column tile
  boundaries; its old longest prompt was one token short of ever seeing
  the bug.
- **Truncated tool calls reported `finish_reason:"tool_calls"`** on all
  three API dialects, converting the loud failure this engine exists to
  prevent into a silent one. A truncated call now keeps its truncation
  signal on every surface (external evaluation finding A).
- **`--quantize` copied `general.file_type` from the parent**, mislabeling
  mixed-retention outputs. The declared type now derives from the output
  histogram (finding B).
- **An unrecognised chat template silently fell back to llama2 markup.**
  gpt-oss chat was fed `[INST]`/`<<SYS>>` it had never seen and ran away
  past every stop; the fallback now warns loudly — and gpt-oss no longer
  needs it (see Harmony below).
- The gpt-oss tokenizer differential went **222/721 divergent strings to
  0/721** by mapping its `gpt-4o` pre-type onto the o200k splitter.
- A sweep-and-review pass fixed a heap over-read in the atem parser
  (ASan), bound-aware recovery for truncated numeric arguments,
  closest-prefix recovery for truncated enums, thread-safety of quant
  arithmetic under fast-math (now confined to a `-fno-fast-math`
  translation unit), and `system()` calls in the tray (now `posix_spawn`).

### New capabilities

- **Muse native atem tool calling**, constrained by the schema compiler:
  tool definitions rendered in the model's own format, generation
  constrained from the recipient header, truncation-surviving closes,
  multi-call turns, buffered and SSE parsing, and the model's own
  protocol control tokens satisfying the automaton so generation stays
  on-distribution. Certified on the real model, 120/120 torture matrix.
- **TMPL_HARMONY**: gpt-oss chat renders its real format — channel-aware
  turns, developer role, its own stop set — with the analysis channel
  suppressed from content and surfaced as `reasoning_content`,
  `enable_thinking` as the control. Before/after transcripts in
  `docs/gpt-oss-harmony-2026-08-14.md`.
- **Multi-part GGUF loads natively.** Standard numbered split sets map
  through independent mappings; missing or inconsistent sets refuse
  loudly; a real split model reproduces the whole file's output SHA.
- **Streaming parallel tool calls** on the generic JSON envelope path;
  the `parallel_tool_calls`+`stream` refusal is gone.
- **VRAM registry priorities and cooperative yield**: advisory priority
  tags on claims (`--vram-priority`), priority-ordered `--wait-for-vram`
  acquisition, and `--yield-on-request` — a holder can be asked, never
  forced, to release at an idle point.
- **`--type-plan` per-tensor precision in the quantizer**, integrity-gated
  (untouched tensors byte-identical to the source). This is the tool
  behind the selective-precision artifact class: per-tensor-class
  precision is the finest GGUF can express (experts are stacked), and it
  is enough — see Artifacts.
- **Q3_K writer for `--type-plan`**: stacked MoE expert banks can now move to
  Q3_K while unmatched attention/shared tensors remain byte-identical. A
  hermetic in-process GGUF test pins the writer/reader layout, exact grid
  round-trip, and exact zero.
- **Quality bar v2**: gate tooling reports margin-qualified top-1
  (0.5-nat reference-side tie band, derived from the tc-tol precedent)
  beside plain top-1, both always printed. Adopted as the publication
  criterion 2026-08-14.
- **`scripts/quant-fidelity.py`**: the quant-vs-tool-call-fidelity
  harness — per-quant schema conformance, tool selection, argument
  agreement and KLD against a reference variant, self-validating
  zero-point that refuses to measure on any disagreement.
- **Machine-readable compatibility ledger**: `docs/compat-reports/`
  carries dated per-release reports; the manifest schema now declares
  executable contracts for cpu_cuda/chat/tool check classes, and checks
  that did not run say so with reasons.

### Performance, measured against llama.cpp on the same hardware

- **CPU decode +32-34%, byte-identical**: the thread pool spent
  65-138 us per matvec handoff (38-59% of every decode token);
  spin-then-park wakeups fixed it. Dense CPU decode moved from 50-60% to
  66-78% of llama.cpp.
- **CUDA prefill up to 28.8x on previously uncovered combos**: Q4_0
  promoted through the tolerance gate across four architectures, granite
  admitted to the TC path, and Q4_0 gained its missing coalesced decode
  GEMV (4.4-5.4x, token-identical). Honest same-slice table: decode
  77-87%, prefill 6.1-9.8% of llama.cpp (`docs/benchmarks.md`).
- **Metal prefill +23.6% at defaults on M1**: half threadgroup staging,
  64x32 tiles, memory-aware batch default. The matvec multi-row rework
  was measured NEGATIVE under the byte-identity contract and not shipped
  (`docs/negative-result-metal-multirow-matvec.md`); a latent activation
  alignment hazard was fixed on the way.
- A fused int8 CPU dot ships gated OFF (`RUNNER_CPU_I8=1`): 2.4-2.5x in
  kernel isolation, ~6% end to end, and it flips near-tie tokens, so it
  did not meet the 0/64 promotion bar.

### Artifacts and measured claims

- **New flagship: Qwen3-30B-A3B selective precision** (attention Q8_0 /
  experts Q4_0, 17.99 GB) — PASSES the adopted bar where the official
  uniform Q4_K_M fails it, from a byte-verified first-party Q8_0 source.
- **Qwen3-Coder-30B keep-120** passes both the original and the current
  bar — the only published artifact to clear the original bar unaided.
- **gpt-oss-20b keep-30's quality claim is withdrawn**: the published
  97.5% does not reproduce at its own protocol on byte-identical files.
  The file stays published as a measured near-miss; its card leads with
  the current numbers.
- **The 4-bit size threshold**: Q4_K_M passes the bar at 8B and 14B,
  fails at 5B and below, on everything measured. Legacy Q4_0 is 6.7x
  worse than Q4_K_M on the same 14B model. Ship k-quants, never Q4_0.
- **The split story, measured on two families**: constrained decoding
  holds schema conformance and tool selection at 100% down to Q4_0 while
  argument agreement decays to 50%. The shape of a tool call is
  quant-proof; its contents are not (`docs/quant-fidelity.md`).
- Quickstart now recommends granite-4.1-3b Q8_0 (3.6 GB, the smallest
  model passing the fidelity gate against its own BF16).

## v0.1.15-alpha — 2026-08-11

- **New architecture: `muse-glimmer` (Meta Muse Glimmer 30B, text path),
  certified.** Gated attention, per-head QK norms, sandwich norms at a fixed
  1e-8 epsilon, a sliding-window pattern array whose full-attention layers are
  NoPE, and a scaled + softcapped logit head — transcribed from the reference
  implementation and gated on real weights: tokenizer differential 0/721,
  CPU/CUDA 6/6 byte-identical at full offload, greedy reference identity at
  the model's measured sensitivity floor, chat with the reasoning turn split
  into `reasoning_content`. Evidence: `docs/muse-glimmer-cert-2026-08-11.md`.
  The separate vision encoder and the atem tool syntax are not implemented.
- **New tokenizer pre-type: `llama4`** (the o200k family) — cased letter runs
  with attached case-insensitive contractions, three-digit runs, and `/` in
  the punctuation tail. Previously these files silently fell back to GPT-2
  split rules.
- **New chat template: `muse`** (`<|start|>role<|message|>…<|eot|>`), with
  `<|eot|>` added to the stop-token probes and `enable_thinking:false`
  pinning the generation prompt to a direct answer.
- **Metal: dense gated attention and NoPE layers now run on the GPU** (new
  `k_sigmoid_mul` kernel; NoPE layers skip the rope dispatch). CUDA gains the
  same dense attention gate. Gate-plus-MoE models (afmoe) deliberately keep
  their CPU fallback — that combination has not been run against the
  identity gates.
- **Codebook i-quants: IQ1_S/M, IQ2_XXS/XS/S, IQ3_XXS/S now load and run**
  (CPU only; CUDA and Metal refuse them loudly), with NEON and AVX2 dequant
  kernels — measured 2.9x decode / 2.5x prefill on a 30B IQ3_XXS versus the
  scalar path. Differentially gated against the reference engine's own
  quantizations of the test fixture plus independent double-precision
  decoders in `test_quants_simd`. `--caps` advertises the new formats.
- **New tools:** `scripts/gguf-depth-slice.py` (drop whole transformer layers
  from a GGUF with per-layer metadata arrays filtered to the survivors; its
  fixture gate compares surviving tensor bytes) and the `RUNNER_LAYER_SIM`
  diagnostic (per-layer residual input/output cosine, the measurement a
  depth-prune plan needs).

- **The project is renamed: Gridcore → Xyntetik.** The repo is now
  `Joakimpalm-Zen/xyntetik-runner` (GitHub redirects the old URL), the Python
  client distribution is `xyntetik-runner-client` with import package
  `xyntetik_runner`, and the engine binary is unchanged in behaviour.
- **State directory moved with a one-time migration.** `~/.gridcore/runner/`
  (POSIX) and `%APPDATA%\gridcore\runner\` (Windows) become `~/.xyntetik/…` /
  `%APPDATA%\xyntetik\…`. On first start after the upgrade the old tree —
  `config.json`, `managed.log`, the instance registry — is moved to the new
  path if the new one does not exist yet, so a live install keeps its config
  and registry.
- **Tray registrations migrated.** macOS: the LaunchAgent label/file
  `ai.gridcore.runner.tray` is unloaded and re-created as
  `ai.xyntetik.runner.tray`, preserving autostart. Windows: the `HKCU\…\Run`
  value `GridcoreTray` is re-registered as `XyntetikTray` and the old value
  deleted; the window class is now `XyntetikTrayWnd`.
- **BREAKING: environment variables renamed without aliases.**
  `GRIDCORE_TRAY_DUMP` → `XYNTETIK_TRAY_DUMP`, `GRIDCORE_TRAY_ICON_DUMP` →
  `XYNTETIK_TRAY_ICON_DUMP` (and the test-only `GRIDCORE_TEST_HOME` →
  `XYNTETIK_TEST_HOME`). Old names are ignored; update shell profiles.
- **Unchanged, deliberately:** the `gridcore.agent.*` GGUF metadata keys and
  the `gridcore` sampler-preset family (matching `general.name`
  `"gridcore-<size>"` / `"Syntetik…"`) — both are contracts with already
  published model artifacts, and the model project's rename is sequenced
  separately. The VRAM registry filename prefix is now `xyntetik-vram-`; a
  stale `gridcore-vram-*.reg` from an older build is simply ignored.

## v0.1.14-alpha — 2026-08-10

- **Metal stops falling back to the CPU on the formats small Macs actually
  use.** `--caps` advertised IQ4_NL and IQ4_XS as GPU-capable while the Metal
  backend accepted neither, so an Apple Silicon user got a silent full-CPU
  fallback on exactly the quants an 8–16 GB machine reaches for. Five matvec
  kernels are new — q2_K, q3_K, iq4_nl, iq4_xs and bf16 — each byte-identical
  to the CPU path, and `--caps` now reports Metal's real support.
- **Metal prefill went from a regression to a large win.** The new matvec
  kernels sped up decode but left prefill on a fallback that re-reads every
  weight once per token column, which was slower on the GPU than on the CPU.
  Tiled GEMM for the same five types fixes it (prompt tok/s, M1):

  | model | CPU | Metal (matvec) | Metal (tiled) |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | tinyllama-1.1b Q2_K | 36.91 | 28.20 | **192.10** |
  | SmolLM2-360M IQ4_XS | 101.21 | 87.50 | **445.80** |
  | SmolLM2-135M Q2_K | 285.79 | — | **892.83** |
  | SmolLM2-135M bf16 | 296.23 | — | **848.69** |

  0.76x against the CPU becomes 5.20x, and 0.86x becomes 4.40x.
- **f16 and bf16 decode now beat the CPU instead of losing to it.** Both loaded
  one weight per lane step while every quant kernel already loaded wide; four
  per step takes f16 from 0.91x to 1.03x and bf16 from 0.91x to 1.04x on an M1
  (135M model, medians of three interleaved runs), output unchanged.
- **CUDA: Q8_0 runs on tensor cores by default.** Prefill goes 113.72 → 475.71
  tok/s, 4.18x, on Qwen3-4B-Q8_0. The logits are bit-identical across 504
  counted tensor-core dispatches rather than merely within tolerance: int8
  weights convert to fp16 without loss and the accumulation order matches the
  scalar path, so there is no numerical difference for an architecture to
  amplify. The kernel already existed and was simply never dispatched. Measured
  on sm_86.
- **Structured output supports bounded repetition.** Schema patterns accept
  `{n}` and `{n,m}` alongside the two unbounded forms. The ceiling is enforced
  during decoding rather than at the closing quote, which is what the previous
  floor-only validator could not express.
- **Qwen3 can be asked not to reason.** A ChatML variant whose own template
  declares `<think>` carries a tri-state thinking control, because the
  references disagree; detection reads the model's template rather than
  matching names, so it follows the checkpoint.
- **`reasoning_limit` is no longer emitted on the OpenAI surfaces.** It is not
  in the OpenAI `finish_reason` enum; it maps to the standard `length`.
  `finish_detail` is now carried into streamed turns.
- **A thread count above the pool maximum is clamped loudly.** `-t 128`
  behaved exactly like `-t 64` with nothing on stderr; the caller asked for N,
  got 64, and had no way to find out.
- **Two gates were vacuous and are now real.** The VRAM leak gate could not
  detect the bug it exists for: a deliberate 4.1 GB leak, six times, on an
  8.59 GB card produced 0.0 MB of drift and a green result, because releasing
  the CUDA primary context reclaims every allocation inside it. It now pins the
  context, and treats a single catastrophic window as a leak rather than
  requiring both windows to lose memory — the two-window rule inverts when the
  first leak exhausts the card. The tensor-core tolerance gate now tells
  "matched exactly" apart from "never ran", which are bit-identical outcomes
  demanding opposite verdicts.
- **A gemma-4 prompt change was reverted after measuring it.** An empty
  thought-block pre-seed was added to the non-thinking generation prompt from a
  summary of the reference template; the construct does not exist in the
  model's own `tokenizer.chat_template`, and it cost 0.275. The original
  unconditional form was correct.
- **The build fails on discarded recipes.** "overriding commands for target" is
  never benign — it always means a recipe was silently thrown away, and it had
  been hiding a dead test target on every build. Windows warnings are
  actionable and the fast-math sentinel warnings are gone.
- New `scripts/weight-io-bench.py` reports mapped-fault versus explicit-read
  bandwidth for large weight files, with tests and `make test-weight-io-bench`.
- New gates cover the Metal f16 parity path, Metal K-quant index geometry, the
  prefix half-budget truncation clamp, reservation auto-fit arithmetic, and the
  KV-evicts-weights threshold.

Known limitation: `--caps` still describes CPU and GPU quant support with one
hardcoded list, which cannot be correct for both backends — CUDA has IQ4 and no
q2_K, Metal now has q2_K. It currently understates Metal, which is the safe
direction, but it is not accurate.

## v0.1.13-alpha — 2026-08-08

- **CUDA prefill is 82% faster: 199.5 → 363.4 tok/s** (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell
  MIG slice, Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M, ~3.1k prompt, three interleaved rounds each,
  spreads under 0.1%). Three independent changes:
  - **Prefill token tile widened 16 → 64 (+35%).** `MVB` was doing two jobs —
    the width every activation buffer is allocated for, *and* the compile-time
    tile baked into the scalar kernels (`float s[MVB]`,
    `__shared__ float xsm[MVB][256]`). At 64 the register array spills and the
    shared tile is 64 KB against a 48 KB cap, which is why this looked blocked.
    `MVT` is now the scalar tile and `MVB` the buffer width; fixed-tile kernels
    run `ceil(batch/tile)` launches, generalising the split `k_gemm_q8_0`
    already used. The epilogue tile aliases the weight tile (both 16 KB,
    disjoint lifetimes) to stay under the cap. The decoupling alone was worth
    +14% before any tile widened, because wider buffers widen the outer tile
    too and norms/rope/attention now run 64 tokens per pass instead of 16.
  - **Tensor-core Q6_K GEMM (+9.8%).** Only q4_K, q8_0 and q4_0 had `_tc`
    kernels, so `attn_v` and `ffn_down` in every `Q4_K_M` file — 40% of all
    GEMM calls — ran the scalar path. The new kernel is 2.35x faster on that
    work; unpacking is lifted verbatim from `k_gemm_q6_K`, including the
    integer `sc * q` before the float multiply, so it matches element for
    element.
  - **Attention V accumulation spread across the block (+22.8%).**
    `for (i2 = tid; i2 < hd/2; i2 += tpg)` used 64 of 128 threads at
    head_dim 128 while each walked the entire context serially. Each thread
    now owns a (lane, position-chunk) pair. Where lanes exceed the block
    (head_dim > 512, which gemma4's `key_length` default reaches) the original
    loop is kept — the chunked form would leave the upper dims unwritten.
  Decode is unchanged at matched context. CPU/GPU byte-identical on Qwen3-4B,
  gemma-4-E4B, SmolLM2-135M, Qwen2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B, including the
  sliding-window path.
- **The paging warning is MoE-aware.** It told a 16 GB Mac that every token
  would page from disk while gemma-4-26B-A4B was serving 8+ tok/s there. It
  now estimates the per-token hot set — everything except the *unrouted*
  expert banks — and reports both figures: 2.4 GB touched per token against a
  14.4 GB file. Dense models keep the original wording verbatim, and the
  `--mlock` hint is dropped when the hot set fits but the file does not,
  because pinning a file that does not fit is not the fix for that.
- **`--caps` publishes `gpu.eseries`**, so a placement scheduler can tell a box
  that runs gemma-4 E-series on the device from one that silently falls back.
  Follows `gpu_moe_ok()` exactly: Metal true since 0.1.11, CUDA true, stub
  false.
- **The tray re-reads an externally edited `config.json`.** A hand-edited model
  path or port needed a tray restart; `cfg_load()` now stats the file and
  re-reads on change, with size compared alongside `st_mtime` because
  whole-second timestamps miss an edit landing in the same second as the read.
- **A split (multi-part) GGUF is refused by name.** Handed part 1 of a 3-part
  model, runner bound whatever that part held and printed a wall of
  `missing tensor blk.N...` while `split.count` sat in metadata it had already
  parsed. It now says which part, out of how many, names the expected set and
  points at `llama-gguf-split --merge`. `scripts/gguf-split.py` produces
  fixtures in llama.cpp's layout.
- **`make test` no longer dies on dash.** `test-shader-embed` used a bash
  here-string, so the suite failed at parse time on Debian/Ubuntu — i.e. most
  Linux. CI never caught it because CI does not run `make test`.
- Metal fixture coverage for the geometries and MoE layouts nothing pinned:
  dense gemma3/gemma4 with and without SWA, qwen3 SWA, E-series,
  gemma4-hetero, and identical-or-refused-loudly for the split expert layout
  and the shared always-on expert. `--arch gemma4` fixtures did not load at
  all before this — and because both arms failed identically, a CPU-vs-Metal
  comparison of their empty output reported a match.

## v0.1.12-alpha — 2026-08-07

- **A bare `runner` now starts the tray** (macOS, Windows). Double-clicking
  the binary — or typing `runner` with no arguments in a terminal — launches
  the menu-bar controller instead of printing help text that vanishes with
  the window. The conditions are deliberately narrow, and everything else is
  untouched: literally zero arguments (every scripted invocation passes
  something, so none can be affected), stdin *and* stdout must be a real
  terminal (pipes, CI, and probes still get usage text and a nonzero exit),
  and platforms without a tray backend (Linux) keep the old behavior
  exactly. `--no-tray` is the standing opt-out for wrappers that want
  bare-invocation behavior guaranteed text-only, whatever the conditions
  above may become later. Pinned by `make test-bare-invocation`, which runs
  the piped-stdin case — a GUI event loop there would hang every script that
  probes the binary, including the test itself.

- **MoE expert prefetch: the default is now decided per machine class, and
  Apple Silicon earned ON.** v0.1.11 shipped it off pending a second machine
  agreeing. The second machine agreed the next morning: a 16 GB M2 Pro at
  3.2x oversubscription measured decode 2.68 → **3.37 tok/s (1.26x)** and
  prompt 1.65 → **2.54 (1.54x)**, three interleaved rounds, the arms fully
  disjoint — the worst prefetch-on run beat the best prefetch-off run on
  both metrics. Since the M2 Pro ran at *higher* oversubscription than the
  Linux null (3.2x vs 2.24x), the differentiator is the storage class's
  fault cost, not the oversubscription ratio. So: **auto = on for Apple
  Silicon when weights exceed available RAM** (the two-machine measured
  case), **off everywhere else** (the measured null). The Linux default
  changes when someone measures a win there, not before.

- **`--moe-prefetch on|off|auto` — the opt-in becomes a real flag.** Field
  report from the 16 GB deployment: `RUNNER_MOE_PREFETCH=1` set in a shell
  profile does not survive the tray's login LaunchAgent, which runs with
  launchd's environment — so after a reboot the same server came up ~26%
  slower with nothing in the banner chain to say why. A measured win that
  silently evaporates on relaunch reads as a regression. The flag persists
  through the tray's `last_args` like every other knob; precedence is flag
  over env over the per-class default, pinned by tests including both
  override directions.

## v0.1.11-alpha — 2026-08-06

- **MoE expert prefetch: routed experts are handed to the OS as whole blocks.**
  On a model larger than RAM the engine's cost is not bandwidth and not
  arithmetic — it is the NUMBER of I/O operations. Reaching an expert through
  the mmap costs ~200 synchronous 16 KB faults; measured on gemma-4-26B on an
  8 GB M1 that is **~17,000 faults per token at ~45–60 µs each**, which is the
  entire token budget (4x the threads bought 1.32x, and warming the page cache
  halved the faults without moving throughput at all). The router has just
  named the experts this layer will read, so those byte ranges now go to the
  OS as whole blocks. Measured, CPU, weights ~4x available RAM:

  | model | prefill | decode |
  |---|---|---|
  | gemma-4-26B-A4B QAT Q4_0 | 2.61 → **4.33** tok/s (1.66x) | 1.37 → **1.96** tok/s (1.43x) |
  | gpt-oss-20b keep-30 MXFP4 | 0.42 → **0.80** tok/s (1.90x) | 0.61 → **1.04** tok/s (1.70x) |

  **It cannot change output.** The advice is purely about how many faults a
  read costs, never what it returns — verified byte-identical on every MoE
  fixture with it forced on and off.
  **It is not a cache**, deliberately: no residency set, no eviction, no
  hit-rate policy. A standalone probe replaying real routing traces against the
  real GGUF measured cross-workload committee hit rates at 13.7% (top-8) and
  24.8% (top-16) — caching contributes little and does not generalize, while
  granularity alone captures the win.
  **It is architecture-agnostic.** The only thing it takes from the model is
  the list of expert ids a router just produced. It is fed by *whichever*
  router ran, so it engages on gemma-4's dual-branch MoE and gpt-oss's generic
  path alike — unlike the rejected `--expert-cache` tier, which hooked one
  specific FFN path and therefore never engaged on gemma-4 at all
  (`docs/negative-result-expert-cache.md`).

  **It is OFF by default, and the table above is why it does not get to be
  on.** Every number in it is Apple Silicon, far oversubscribed, on slow
  storage. Re-measured on Linux with XFS at 425 MB/s and 2.24x
  oversubscription, against a RAM cap verified to hold, the feature is
  **neutral to slightly negative** — 0.22 tok/s off versus 0.21 on, with
  marginally *more* major faults enabled. That is coherent (fewer faults to
  save when faults are cheap), but it means the win is a property of one
  machine class rather than of the technique, and one machine class is not
  grounds for a default. `RUNNER_MOE_PREFETCH=1` opts in, `=0` forces off.
  It gets the default back when a second machine class agrees, with the
  number attached.


- **Metal prefill is batched: 3.0x on the prompt path, and the Gemma
  families get it too.** Issue #6 — prefill ran at decode speed because
  the prompt batch encoded per-token chains: every weight matrix was
  re-streamed once per token, and each token cost ~10 tiny dispatches per
  layer. The batch now issues one dispatch per layer for each of rmsnorm,
  the Q/K/V/O and FFN matmuls, rope, KV store and attention. Kernels gained
  an explicit column dimension with strides passed in (the scratch is not
  uniformly strided — `xb` is strided by `xdim = max(q_dim, n_embd)`), plus
  a tunable `col_tile` (`RUNNER_METAL_COL_TILE`, default 8): one threadgroup
  per row across ALL columns maximizes cache reuse but serializes the batch
  and starves the GPU of threadgroups, so columns are tiled to keep
  parallelism while still amortizing each weight fetch. Per-element
  arithmetic and the `simd_sum` order are unchanged, so a batched prefill is
  bit-identical to per-token submits. Logits are no longer computed for
  every prompt position when only the last is read.
  Measured on an M1, SmolLM2-135M Q8_0, 601-token prompt, interleaved A/B
  against a binary built from the previous commit: **prefill 119 -> 358
  tok/s (3.0x)**, and Metal now beats the CPU path (273 tok/s) instead of
  losing to it by 2.3x. Decode is unchanged (~68 tok/s) — n=1 has nothing
  to batch.
- **A Metal shader-compile failure can no longer pass unnoticed.** It was the
  quietest failure in the backend: `gpu_init` printed a line, returned false,
  and the model ran correctly on the CPU — so a hand-run "CPU vs GPU" check
  compared the CPU path with itself and passed. That happened during this
  release's prefill work, and briefly made a fallback look like a speedup.
  Two guards: `make test` now runs a shader gate on macOS
  (`tests/test_metal_shaders.m`) that compiles the embedded library and looks
  up every kernel `mk_pipeline()` asks for — verified to fail on both a broken
  kernel and a renamed one; and `--caps` no longer reports a Metal backend
  when the library will not compile, because `--caps` exists to let a
  scheduler place work before dispatching and a device that cannot run is not
  a backend. A missing *function* was quieter still: `mk_pipeline` returns nil
  and the tiled-GEMM path silently degrades to the matvec path — a large
  performance regression with no wrong answer for a correctness gate to catch.
- **MoE and E-series join the Metal batched path; one encoder now, not two.**
  MoE layers were excluded because `enc_gemma_moe_ffn` read the residual at a
  fixed offset 0; both MoE encoders now take an explicit token offset, so
  attention, the projections and the norms run once for the batch while the
  MoE FFN stays per-token (routing picks different experts per token — there
  is no shared weight tile to amortize).
  **gemma-4 E-series runs on Metal at all for the first time** (a standing
  field report: "E-series gets no Metal path"). `gpu_init` used to refuse it
  outright. Implemented: the per-layer-embedding branch, and per-layer FFN
  widths — which together unblock E2B *and* E4B. Real gemma-4 E2B Q4_K_M is
  byte-identical CPU vs Metal, and prefills at 40.3 tok/s against the CPU
  path's 19.6.
  Building the PLE table needed care: `model_forward_batch` deliberately skips
  its own prepass under full offload because CUDA stages the table on-device,
  so Metal was reading a stale one; it now builds the table from the scaled
  embeddings it just wrote.
- **Fixed: shared-KV layers were silently wrong on Metal.** A gemma-4 E-series
  layer past `kv_from_start` owns no cache rows — it projects Q only and
  attends over the layer `model_kv_byte_off()` aliases to, exactly as the CUDA
  backend does. Metal projected K/V anyway and stored them, overwriting the
  source layer's rows. Real E-series models never reached it because the
  per-layer-embedding refusal turned them away first, so this had no symptom
  until that refusal was lifted — but a shared-KV-only model would have
  produced wrong output with no gate to catch it. Pinned by the new
  `make test-metal-eseries` (PLE only, shared-KV only, and both).
- **The per-token Metal encoder is gone.** Keeping a second implementation of
  the same layer loop cost three defects — features silently missing behind an
  eligibility check, a double-applied logit softcap, and wrong output on real
  gemma-4 E2B weights — each invisible to the gates until something else
  exposed it. One encoder now serves every batch size including decode; a
  scratch-allocation failure falls back to the CPU loudly instead of to a
  second, drift-prone path. `tests/test_eseries.py` goes from 9 passed /
  8 skipped to 17 passed: its GPU tests had been skipping because the backend
  refused the models.
- **Tiled prefill GEMM on Metal, behind the tolerance gate: 768 tok/s.**
  The matvec kernels give one output element per simdgroup — 32 lanes each
  doing one FMA, then a log-depth reduction — so almost none of the work is
  reuse. `k_mm_*` computes an output TILE per threadgroup with Apple's
  simdgroup matrix units (32 rows x 16 columns, k-step 32, weights loaded
  transposed straight out of threadgroup memory). Implemented for F32, F16,
  Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_K, Q6_K and MXFP4; anything else keeps the matvec path.
  It is deliberately NOT bit-identical and cannot be — the weight is
  dequantized before the multiply, and the sum is reassociated into 8-element
  matrix steps — so, exactly like the CUDA tensor-core prefill, it answers to
  `tests/test_tc_tol.c` rather than to an identity claim it cannot honour.
  `gpu_tc_force()` drives it from the gate; `RUNNER_METAL_MM=0` pins the
  matvec path, and the Metal identity smokes now pin it (as the CUDA
  harnesses pin `RUNNER_CUDA_TC=0`), so each gate tests the path it claims.
  Measured, SmolLM2-135M Q8_0, 601-token prompt on an M1: **prefill 360 ->
  768 tok/s** on top of the batching below — **6.4x over the 119 tok/s this
  release started from**, and 2.8x the CPU path. Gate results on real
  weights: Q8_0 mean|dlogit| 0.00003 of logit range and 0/64 top-1 flips;
  gemma-3-4b Q4_K_M 0.00001 of range and 0/64 flips (limits 0.005 and 5%).
  The gate earned its keep immediately — it caught a genuine Q6_K nibble/byte
  indexing bug (14/64 flips with decisive margins) that greedy output and
  every identity smoke had missed.
- **The two Metal forward paths were merged.** The prompt-batch encoder
  duplicated the layer loop and silently lacked features, which an
  eligibility check papered over — so every Gemma model took per-token
  submits and got none of the above. It now implements embedding scale,
  the weightless V norm and V-less layers, sandwich norms, per-layer output
  scale, GELU and heterogeneous per-layer geometry. Real gemma-3-4b-it
  Q4_K_M: byte-identical CPU vs Metal, prefill 5.3 -> 7.2 tok/s on a
  paging-bound M1. Still on per-token submits, honestly: MoE layers (their
  encoders address scratch at a fixed offset 0) and E-series per-layer
  embeddings (no batched prepass).
- **Fixed: Metal applied logit softcap twice.** `model_forward_batch`
  applies head transforms on the host for both the batched and solo paths —
  by design, so they cannot drift — and the Metal encoder applied them
  again. Softcap is monotonic, so greedy argmax never saw it and no
  identity gate could fail; it distorted logprobs and any temperature/top-p
  sampling on softcapped models (the Gemma families). The backend-side copy
  is removed.

## v0.1.10-alpha — 2026-08-06

The Metal release: the Gemma families stop falling back to CPU on Apple
Silicon, and a latent fast-math defect that would have produced NaN on real
Gemma weights is fixed and pinned before anyone could hit it.

- **gemma-4 runs on Metal.** The heterogeneous-attention refusal is
  retired: the per-token Metal path already carried per-layer
  head_dim/KV-head/rope geometry, V-less layers (V from the raw K
  projection), the weightless V head-norm, sandwich norms, per-layer
  output scale and the logit softcap — it was gated off, never exercised.
  Now: scratch buffers size off the per-layer maxima, the dense-FFN
  activation selects GELU when the arch calls for it (unlocks dense
  gemma3/gemma4 class models past the activation gate), and the native
  prompt-batch fast path gained an explicit eligibility check naming the
  features it implements — models carrying anything beyond the plain
  llama shape (MoE, GELU, embedding scale, V norms, sandwich norms,
  out-scales, softcap/suppress, heterogeneous geometry) take the
  per-token path instead of a silently-wrong batch. Pinned by two new
  heterogeneous fixtures (dense + dual-branch MoE, both with V-less full
  layers) under `make test-metal-gemma4-hetero`, byte-identical CPU vs
  Metal.

- **Metal GELU produced NaN on real Gemma weights — fixed.** Enabling the
  path above exposed it immediately: gemma-3-4b-it emitted nothing but
  token 0, with NaN logits, from layer 0. Metal compiles kernels with fast
  math, where `tanh()` is evaluated through `exp(2a)`; the GELU tanh
  argument grows as x^3, overflows to `inf`, and `inf/inf` is NaN. libm's
  `tanhf` on the CPU oracle saturates instead, and CUDA is unaffected
  (nvcc is not built with `-use_fast_math`), which is why the arch was
  certified on CUDA with the defect latent on Metal. The kernel now clamps
  the tanh argument to a magnitude where the result is already exactly
  ±1.0f in fp32, so the guard cannot change any representable value — the
  same hazard and the same remedy as the `g < -80` early-out in the CPU
  silu path. Pinned by `make test-metal-gelu-overflow` (a fixture whose
  gate weights reach the overflow; verified to fail without the fix), and
  validated on real weights: **gemma-3-4b-it Q4_K_M is byte-identical CPU
  vs Metal over 32 greedy tokens** on an M1.

- `RUNNER_METAL_NAN_TRACE=1`: submit after each Metal layer and report the
  first buffer carrying NaN/Inf. The GPU path had no equivalent of
  `RUNNER_DEBUG_ACT`, so a backend silently producing NaN logits could
  only be bisected by guesswork; this found the defect above in three
  runs. Off by default, one env read per forward.

## v0.1.9-alpha — 2026-08-06

The desktop release, plus a certification survey that sharpened the
recommendations: the tray controller lands on macOS and Windows, gemma-4
E2B loads (the last locally-blocked Gemma-4 variant), a 19-model
derivative-certification campaign is folded into the docs, and the README
now carries **standing model recommendations per machine RAM**, each backed
by a measured run.

- **Certified-models README restructured**: one merged table (EU roster
  folded in), plus the new *Recommended models by machine RAM* section —
  8 GB Apple Silicon: Trinity-Nano (13.25 tok/s, resident); 16 GB:
  keep-30 (13.2–13.3 tok/s capped) or gemma-4-26B QAT `--kv q8`
  (7.1–7.3 tok/s capped, live validation pending); 24 GB GPU:
  Qwen3-30B-A3B (~72 tok/s). Models larger than RAM are recommended in
  no configuration — the streaming/paging regimes were measured and
  rejected (see `docs/negative-result-expert-cache.md`).
- **Cert-matrix campaign docs** (`docs/cert-matrix-status.md`,
  `docs/cert-matrix-2026-08-05.md` + evidence): 19 GPT-OSS × Gemma-4
  derivatives certified/failed/refused against the gates; only the
  Gemma-4 family certifies. Two capability gaps documented with root
  causes: no split/multi-part GGUF support, and the E2B loader gap fixed
  below. The compatibility manifest gained the missing `afmoe` pin and
  the README table the missing `apertus` row.

- **gemma-4 E2B loads: per-layer FFN widths.** E2B publishes real
  per-layer width variation (6144/12288) as an ARRAY-typed
  `feed_forward_length`, which the u32 getter silently read as 0 —
  refusing every E2B conversion, QAT or not (cert-matrix roster item 7).
  A new per-index getter (`gguf_get_u32_idx`) serves scalar and array
  forms, each layer carries its own dense-FFN width through the CPU
  forward path, and `--ffn-widths` on the fixture generator pins it in
  `tests/test_eseries.py`. Heterogeneous widths are CPU-only for now:
  CUDA and Metal refuse loudly and fall back rather than compute with one
  global width (verified byte-identical output either way on the real
  E2B-it Q4_K_M: loads, decodes coherently at 10.7 tok/s on an M1).

- Metal fit ceiling made visible (16 GB-Mac field report): the weight
  buffer allocation failure now prints requested bytes vs the device
  working-set limit ("11.5 GB requested, device working-set limit 5.7 GB —
  model exceeds Metal fit ceiling") instead of a bare "allocation" line,
  and `--caps` publishes the ceiling as `gpu.max_working_set_bytes` so a
  scheduler can apply the placement rule before attempting a load.
  `docs/moe-support.md`'s open item is closed with the measured floor:
  full `gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4` on Metal needs ≥ 24 GB unified memory; 16 GB
  machines get the CPU paging path (2.33 tok/s measured) and should run
  the pruned keep-30 artifact instead.

- **`--tray`: desktop tray / menu-bar controller (macOS + Windows).** A
  code-drawn grid icon lists every live runner instance on the machine
  with its loaded models (swap-mode servers are asked live via
  `GET /v1/models`), stops any of them, and starts one pre-configured
  desktop-managed server; login autostart via LaunchAgent / HKCU Run.
  Backed by a new instance discovery registry: every run-mode process
  writes `<config>/gridcore/runner/instances/<pid>.json` at startup
  (atomic, best-effort, swept by readers when the pid dies), so nothing
  in the serve or inference paths changed. `docs/tray-controller.md`.
- Makefile: recursive sub-make calls quote `$(PYTHON)`, fixing
  `make test PYTHON="py -3"` (the Python launcher is the normal recipe
  on Windows boxes without an MSYS2 python).

## v0.1.8-alpha — 2026-08-05

- **New architecture: `afmoe` (Arcee Trinity family — Trinity-Nano-Preview,
  Trinity-Mini).** Plain-transformer sparse MoE with muP-scaled embeddings,
  Qwen-G1 output-gated attention (a per-element sigmoid gate from a separate
  `attn_gate` projection — shares the qwen35 gate machinery), per-head-dim
  QK norms, a 3-local:1-global sliding-window pattern whose global layers
  are NoPE (the Llama-4 knob at step 4), DeepSeek-style sigmoid routing with
  a selection-only bias plus renormalized weights scaled by
  `expert_weights_scale`, one always-on shared expert, and leading dense
  blocks. New `afmoe` pre-tokenizer (right-aligned digit-triplet splitting,
  CJK/Asian-script isolation, punctuation-letter contractions). CPU only:
  Metal and CUDA refuse loudly and fall back. Certification record in the
  README table. Admission gates: tokenizer differential 0/721; layer-0
  attention path verified vs llama.cpp b10280 to ~2e-4; chat smoke and
  perf rows green on an 8 GB M1 (Q4_K_M resident: 13.25 tok/s decode
  CPU-only; Q8_0 under memory pressure: 8.9). Token identity not claimed,
  with the mechanism measured, not presumed — afmoe's per-branch
  re-normalization amplifies the engines' by-design quantized-matvec
  arithmetic difference (docs/afmoe-divergence-triage-2026-08-05.md).
- The `sampling:` banner at `--temp 0` now says what is actually true —
  greedy argmax, shaping knobs inactive — instead of printing a
  `repeat_penalty` value that does not apply. The penalty was already
  correctly bypassed in greedy mode; the banner misled an external
  reviewer during the afmoe certification run into ruling it out by hand.

## v0.1.7-alpha — 2026-08-05

### We found a 13× optimization and rejected it

We prototyped an expert-residency cache for MoE models larger than RAM. At
the extreme it turned 0.05 tok/s into 0.65 tok/s — a 13× speedup, with the
mechanism working exactly as designed (85%+ hit rates, byte-identical
output, reproduced on three platforms). We rejected it anyway: 0.65 tok/s
is not a configuration worth running, and everywhere the model actually
fits in memory the cache made things *slower*. The full measurements and
reasoning are in `docs/negative-result-expert-cache.md`.

That distinction is becoming a core principle of how gridcore-runner is
built: **an optimization doesn't pass because the benchmark got faster. It
has to preserve the model and produce a configuration worth running.** The
same gates that enforce this killed two other superficially attractive
ideas this cycle (deeper expert pruning, sub-4-bit expert requantization —
the latter produced a model that generated fluent text while agreeing with
the reference on 22% of tokens; nothing at load time would have noticed).

### CPU SIMD kernels, measured and gated

- **ARM NEON kernels** for the quantized dot/dequant path on Apple Silicon
  and other aarch64 — added *only* where they measured faster than the
  compiler's auto-vectorized scalar code, per format: Q6_K 8×, IQ4_NL 5×,
  IQ4_XS 4×, MXFP4 1.4×, Q5_K and Q4_0 modest wins. Formats where the
  auto-vectorizer won (F16, BF16, Q8_0, Q4_K) deliberately keep the scalar
  path, with the measurements noted in the source so nobody "optimizes"
  them back in.
- **MXFP4 gets a dedicated dot kernel on every ISA** (NEON, AVX2, scalar).
  It previously fell through to a generic block-dequant path on *all*
  platforms — including x86. On a Windows/AVX2 machine this took gpt-oss
  class decode from 0.21 to 3.4–4.0 tok/s (~16–20×) where the model ≈ fits
  RAM, and 0.15 → 0.54 tok/s on an 8 GB M1 where it doesn't.
- New gate `tests/test_quants_simd.c` (in `make test`): every quant format
  checked against an independent double-precision reference, and q8 KV-row
  quantization pinned byte-identical to its scalar definition. The gate has
  passed on macOS/NEON, Windows/AVX2, Linux/AVX2 and Linux/x86-64-v3.

### Fixed

- **gemma-4 E-series (E2B/E4B) produced silently wrong output under partial
  CUDA offload — shipped in `v0.1.5-alpha` and `v0.1.6-alpha`.** Full offload
  and CPU-only were both correct; any `--gpu-layers N` splitting the model was
  not, for three independent reasons found while trying to measure grammar
  fast-forward on the real E4B model (that path needs >=1 CPU layer). (1) the
  partial-offload upload's byte prefix omitted the per-layer-embedding
  tensors, so every partial split silently kernel-launch-failed and fell back
  to CPU — correct output, wrong device, the existing test only ever compared
  stdout so this went undetected. (2) with that fixed, the CPU-continued
  tail's per-layer-embedding table went stale/zero, because the prepass that
  fills it only ran when the CPU handled the *whole* forward. (3) even
  isolated from per-layer embeddings entirely, the device KV buffer was
  undersized whenever the split boundary landed on a shared-KV (non-cache-
  owning) layer — the real E4B case (`shared_kv_layers=18` of 42, so any
  split in [24,41] hit it) — because the sizing call redirected through "where
  does this layer's data live" when it needed "how many bytes do the first N
  layers need". Verified byte-identical to `--gpu off` on the real E4B model
  at every practical split point; `tests/test_eseries.py` gained an assertion
  that a partial split's stderr shows no fallback (proven red against the
  unfixed code). Metal never does partial offload (only full or fully off),
  so it was never exposed to any of the three.

## v0.1.6-alpha — 2026-08-04

- **Windows: real checkpoints share weights between `--parallel` slots again —
  the split defect is fixed.** The trigger was Branch A of the 2026-08-04
  investigation: MinGW's `stat()` has a 32-bit `st_size`, so on any file past
  2 GB it fails with `EOVERFLOW` ("value too large"), `model_file_identity()`
  lost the identity on **every real checkpoint**, and each `--serve --parallel`
  slot loaded privately and re-decided its own CPU/GPU split under the previous
  slot's VRAM pressure (measured on Qwen3-4B-Q8: slot A 36/36 layers, slot B
  20/36, B wrong on 149,477 of 151,936 logits at step 0). `model_file_identity()`
  now owns the `GetFileInformationByHandle` path that the prefix-cache key
  already used — 64-bit size, stable file index, 100 ns timestamps — so one
  function decides what a file is for the host registry, the device registry
  and the prefix-cache key alike (`stat()` remains the non-NTFS fallback).
  `tests/test_file_identity.c` pins identity at real-checkpoint size with a
  sparse 5 GB file (red before the fix, green after; skips loudly when the disk
  can't spare it). Verified on real weights: `test-shared-weights` exits 0 on
  Qwen3-4B-Q8 and Phi-4-mini-Q8 with identical splits, and a `--serve
  --parallel 2` server answered the same greedy request byte-identically from
  both slots (previously slot-dependent). macOS/Linux were never affected —
  their `stat()` is 64-bit.

- **A load that re-decides its split without a file identity is now reported
  loudly.** Even with the Windows trigger fixed, a genuinely unidentifiable
  file still loads privately and re-decides its split. The GPU registry now
  keeps no-identity entries visible (flagged, never matched) and
  `split_guard()` reports, as an `error:` on stderr, any same-path same-config
  pair whose splits disagree when either side lacks an identity — that
  disagreement is two slots of one server answering one request differently.
  A warning rather than a refusal, because refusing would fall back to CPU,
  which diverges from the resident GPU instance just as silently.
  `make test-split-guard` gates it (proven falsifiable: the harness goes red
  against a guard-less build).

- **A model that cannot be identified on disk now says so instead of silently
  giving up weight sharing.** Both shared-weight registries — the host parse in
  `model.c` and the device upload in `cuda.c` — key on a `stat()`-derived file
  identity, and both treated a failed `stat()` as "load this one privately".
  That fallback is not free: a privately loaded instance also re-decides its own
  CPU/GPU split against whatever VRAM the earlier instances already took, so two
  slots of one `--parallel` server can end up running different numbers of
  layers on the GPU and answering the same request differently. Nothing else in
  a load touches `stat()` — the Windows mapping path uses `GetFileSizeEx` and
  the POSIX one `fstat` — so the failure had no other symptom. The two
  duplicated helpers are now one `model_file_identity()` that reports the path,
  the `errno`, which registry was lost, and the consequence.

  `RUNNER_TEST_NO_FILE_ID=1` forces the failure, because on a machine whose
  `stat()` works nothing in a load can reach that branch. `make
  test-shared-noid` uses it to assert that `test-shared-weights` goes **red**
  without a file identity: the sharing gate had never been shown capable of
  failing, and at the 370 KB default fixture it could not. Under the hook it now
  fails on all four sharing invariants, which is the same host-side signature
  the 2026-08-04 RTX 3070 shelf pass reported when it found the defect.

  Diagnostic and gate only at the time it landed; the underlying split defect
  (Follow-up 3/3a) is fixed by the Windows file-identity entry above.

- **Apertus now runs on CUDA.** The dense device forward path handles its
  ungated `up -> xIELU -> down` FFN and evaluates the four effective per-layer
  xIELU parameters in a native CUDA kernel. The pinned 8B Q4_K_M checkpoint
  fully offloaded 32/32 layers on an RTX 3070 and matched CPU greedy output on
  all five 128-token `cpu_cuda` prompts.

- `--gpu off` now also keeps a speculative draft model on CPU instead of
  silently auto-offloading the draft and consuming VRAM.

- **One-shot and interactive CLI runs now release their model state.** Running
  the README's `make debug` binary under LeakSanitizer found about 240 KB of
  tokenizer, runtime, engine-history, schema/draft, and prompt allocations left
  for process exit. Normal CLI teardown is now explicit, and Linux CI includes
  a leak-enabled CPU smoke (the CUDA driver itself has process-lifetime noise).

- **The model-shelf stress harness now measures the machine it runs on.** Its
  RAM/VRAM defaults were still hard-coded to the earlier 16 GB / 8 GB test box,
  so tiering and placement recommendations were wrong elsewhere. It now reads
  both budgets from `runner --caps`, reports them, and keeps explicit overrides
  for controlled comparisons. It also no longer calls a CPU-only `--gpu auto`
  run CPU/CUDA identity: CUDA evidence is recorded only when the log proves an
  actual GPU split. Apertus now correctly reports `not_executed`, not a vacuous
  pass from comparing CPU with itself.

- **Speculative draft models now honor `--kv q8`.** Draft KV had been forced to
  f16 without explanation even when q8 was requested. The target verifies every
  proposal, so draft-cache loss can affect acceptance and speed but cannot alter
  the target-defined result. On the real Qwen2.5 7B/0.5B pair, 64-token greedy
  speculative output exactly matched plain decoding under both cache types;
  drafting was non-vacuous (92 proposals, 41 accepted with f16 and 42 with q8),
  while draft GPU allocation fell from 0.98 GB to 0.96 GB.

- **Ambiguous duplicate JSON object keys are rejected.** The parser now hashes
  decoded member names while reading each object, so literal duplicates and
  escape-equivalent spellings such as `model` / `m\u006fdel` fail in expected
  O(n) time. This prevents runner's former first-key interpretation from
  disagreeing with last-key-wins clients or proxies. Unit and live HTTP gates
  cover top-level, nested, escaped, and separate-object cases.

- **DNS rebinding and drive-by browser traffic are rejected at the HTTP
  boundary.** Every route, including accept-loop fast paths such as `/health`
  and `/v1/models`, now requires exactly one loopback `Host`; an `Origin`, when
  present, must be an HTTP(S) loopback origin too. Foreign, missing, duplicated,
  malformed, userinfo-bearing, and path-bearing authorities fail with 403.
  This closes the remaining browser-exposure half after `/unload` became
  POST-only. A table-driven C gate exercises the parser directly and live
  conformance checks both fast-path and slot-handled requests.

- **The real write-side stall is now reproducible and gated locally.**
  `scripts/write-stall.py` uses Qwen2.5-7B at 32k context plus a minimum-length
  structured stream to exceed the actual loopback buffers, and reads the exact
  connection's `/proc/net/tcp` transmit queue before judging either path. With
  a 2,304-byte effective client receive buffer, the production timeout run
  queued **396,365 bytes**, released its socket/slot in **31.062 s**, and served
  the next request; the SIGPIPE run queued **267,300 bytes**, survived the
  installed signal disposition, reset the stalled peer, and served again in
  **1.339 s**.

  The experiment found and fixed two bugs. `--ignore-eos` was silently dropped
  by `--serve` because only the one-shot engine received it; an EOS-only server
  fixture now reaches its exact requested limit. And Linux `SO_SNDTIMEO` alone
  left the measured zero-window slot wedged beyond 50 seconds, so Linux now
  applies `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` at the same 30-second bound as well. The timeout-
  blind negative build stayed wedged at 570,154 queued bytes; the SIGPIPE-
  default build died with signal 13. RST/FIN attempts produced `ECONNRESET`,
  not a kernel-delivered SIGPIPE, so the deterministic signal gate injects
  SIGPIPE only after real queue pressure is proved and records that fact.

- **Published competitor rows now have a scheduled freshness alarm.** A cheap
  weekly workflow reads runtime name/version metadata from the committed
  agent-torture reports and compares each competitor's newest published row
  with official llama.cpp/Ollama GitHub releases and vLLM's PyPI release. It
  performs no inference in GitHub CI. Stale rows open or update one tracking
  issue and make the job red; unreachable registries are explicit skips, while
  malformed committed reports remain hard errors. The first live metadata
  check found llama.cpp **b10076 → b10241** and Ollama **0.32.1 → 0.32.5**
  stale; vLLM **0.26.0** is current.

- **Speculative decoding is now a first-class agent-torture runtime axis.**
  `scripts/agent-torture.py --draft PATH --draft-k N` runs the unchanged
  provider-neutral matrix once without and once with the draft server flags,
  then compares every pass/fail verdict by case ID. Any change is a failing
  result because speculation is an optimization, not a new capability row.
  The report records total proposed/accepted tokens, acceptance rate, grammar
  counters, and mismatches; the baseline report and raw evidence are retained
  alongside it. A negative-control unit test changes one draft verdict and
  proves the comparator fails instead of accidentally comparing the baseline
  to itself; a zero-proposal run also fails, catching ignored draft flags.
  Measured on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Q4_K_M plus the same-tokenizer
  Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct Q4_K_M draft: **105/105 matched case for case**, with
  2,325/4,044 proposals accepted (**57.49%**). The CPU-target run took 369.1 s
  versus 337.0 s target-only, so this pair proves correctness and real draft
  activity but is not a speed win on this hardware/configuration.

- **BREAKING: `/unload` is POST-only.** It was a `GET`, which made it reachable
  from any web page the user happened to be visiting —
  `<img src="http://127.0.0.1:PORT/unload">` frees the resident model with no
  preflight, no CORS check and no DNS rebinding needed, because binding to
  loopback does not stop a browser. Verified against the old build: `GET`
  returned 200 and the server logged a real unload. A POST is not a CORS
  *simple* request unless its `Content-Type` says so, so requiring one restores
  the preflight that stands between a drive-by page and a freed model.

  `GET /unload` now answers **405** naming the method, not 404, so an existing
  script says what changed rather than looking like a missing route. A POST
  carrying a body is refused too — `/unload` takes none, and the accept loop is
  the only thread calling `accept()`, so it must not sit draining one.

  This is half the fix. `Host` and `Origin` are still unvalidated, which is what
  DNS rebinding needs, and that is tracked separately.

- **Follow-up to the request-validation hardening: accurate rejection
  messages, and one dead check removed.** The new rules are right and stay;
  what they *said* was not. `max_tokens: 1.5` answered "max_tokens must be a
  number" — 1.5 is a number, so that sends a caller looking for a type bug they
  do not have — and `top_k: 2.5` answered "out of range" when 2.5 is inside
  every bound `top_k` has. They now say "must be a whole number", with a
  separate sentinel so a genuine type error still reads as one.

  The added `seed >= 2^64` guard was **unreachable**: `request_number` already
  caps seed at 18446744073709549568.0, which is 2^64 − 2048, the largest double
  below 2^64 — so the `uint64_t` cast was never at risk and the branch could
  not fire. Verified at the boundary (2^64 − 2048 → 200, 2^64 → 400). Replaced
  with a named `SEED_MAX` and a `_Static_assert` tying the bound to the cast's
  safety, so widening it stops the build instead of quietly reintroducing the
  undefined conversion. Confirmed the assertion fires when the bound is raised.

From a field report on an M2 Pro / 16 GB MacBook Pro driving Continue in
VS Code — the second outside install. The Metal-side findings need a Mac and are
filed; these are the ones that did not.

- **Runner can now tell you its weights are being paged, instead of looking
  healthy while it stalls.** This was the report's worst finding, because every
  signal stayed green through it: on a loaded 16 GB machine an 8B sat at ~0.5 GB
  RSS against a 4.9 GB file and a five-token reply took **53 s at 0.0% CPU**;
  later a 1,200-token prompt returned **nothing in 300 s** while `/v1/models`
  answered instantly and warm-prefix chats came back in 1.5 s. A health check
  and a smoke test both pass while the real workload is dead. Four additions:

  - **`--mlock`** wires the mapping into RAM. Opt-in and fail-soft on purpose —
    locking 5 GB on a 16 GB laptop can cause the pressure it was meant to avoid,
    so a refusal is reported and the load continues.
  - **A load-time warning** when the weights are larger than the RAM actually
    available, because *file size ≤ total RAM* is the test that passes right
    before a machine starts thrashing.
  - **A per-request paging signal.** `runner_telemetry.major_page_faults`, and a
    `[N page-ins — weights not resident]` note on the `[slot]` line when N is
    nonzero. Major faults are the mechanism itself, so a slow request that took
    none was slow for some other reason — better than inferring paging from
    wall-clock.
  - **`ram_available_bytes` in `--caps`**, so a launcher can refuse a model that
    will not stay resident rather than discovering it later.

- **A request that never finishes now leaves a trace.** The `[slot]` line was
  printed on completion only, so the 300-second stall above produced an empty
  log for five minutes. Every request now logs a start line carrying its id,
  prompt length and cache hit, and the id is allocated before any work so both
  lines share one name.

- **`-m name=path` no longer silently costs you `--parallel`.** Naming one model
  to pin the `/v1/models` id — which is what the reporter wanted for a Continue
  config — put the server in swap mode and dropped `--parallel 2` without
  asking. Swap mode really is single-slot, but with one entry there is nothing
  to swap to, so runner now keeps the slots and gives up the registry instead,
  and says which: `/unload` and `--ttl` need more than one model. Two or more
  entries behave exactly as before.

- **`--caps` no longer implies GPU MoE where there is none.** It listed `MXFP4`
  and the `Q*_K` family under `gpu_quants` on every backend, but Metal's
  `gpu_init()` refuses a model with experts *before* it looks at the quant — so
  a Mac user read that as a promise and watched gpt-oss-20b run CPU-only at 0.38
  tok/s. The GPU block now carries `moe` and `kv_q8` booleans, and a
  sparse-MoE model whose experts fell back to the CPU says so in the serve
  banner rather than only in an init line that scrolls past.

- **The JSON-schema test now builds `schema.c` the way the binary does.** It was
  compiled with neither `-O3` nor `-ffast-math`, so `exclusiveMinimum` /
  `exclusiveMaximum` — which use `nextafter(x, ±INFINITY)` — were gated in a
  configuration that does not ship. Measured on gcc the results are identical
  either way, so this is gate integrity rather than a bug fix; but clang warns
  here (`-Wnan-infinity-disabled`) and clang is what a Mac uses, so the test
  should be what finds out.

- **README: verify the byte size of a downloaded model.** `download-model.sh`
  already does. A hand-rolled wrapper did not, and an 8B download truncated at
  290 MB by an HF-CDN reset still reported success, because `curl` exited 56
  inside a compound command that returned 0.

- **The Claude Code end-to-end check is a script now**
  (`scripts/claude-code-e2e.sh`), and re-run against **Claude Code 2.1.220**:
  PASS. It starts a server, writes a fixture holding a sentinel generated for
  that run, points the real CLI at Runner via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and
  requires the sentinel back — so the README's compatibility claim rests on
  something repeatable rather than on one manual validation against one
  version. Runner served the loop with 22,942 of 22,943 prompt tokens coming
  from the prefix cache.

  Two things the script had to learn the hard way, both recorded in it:
  `--allowedTools` governs permission, not what is *declared*, so Claude Code
  sends its entire built-in tool set on the first request and does not fit in
  a 16k context; and the model has to be named explicitly or the CLI keeps
  whatever model the developer's own session is configured with and dies before
  making a request.

- **Torture matrix v2: seven families, 105 cases** (`scripts/agent-torture.py`).
  Two new families, both request-level so other runtimes can be asked the same
  questions: `reasoning_then_tool` (an assistant turn of prose already in the
  history, then a forced call — the failure it catches is content bleeding into
  the call turn) and `structured_final` (a schema-constrained *final answer*
  via `response_format`, which reaches the sampler by a different path than
  tools do and had no torture coverage). 105 = 7 x 15; `SCHEMA_VERSION` is
  bumped to v2 because v1's 100/5 results are not case-for-case comparable.

- **A published benchmark result is corrected: vLLM scores 80/105, not 20/100.**
  The `2026-08-02` row started vLLM without `--tool-call-parser`, and vLLM
  *refuses* `tool_choice` outright in that state — all 80 tool cases came back
  `400 ... requires --tool-call-parser to be set` before the model was asked
  anything. The 20 that passed are exactly the 20 cases that send no `tools`.
  Started correctly it scores **80/105** on the harder v2 matrix. The old
  README now carries the correction, and the new result keeps a reproduction of
  the misconfigured run beside the fixed one so the claim is checkable. Runner
  is 105/105 on the same matrix and its column is unaffected.

  A comparison harness that lets the competitor fail at admission and files it
  as a capability difference is measuring its own setup.

- **First cross-runtime resource footprint**
  (`tests/torture/results/2026-08-03-smollm2-1.7b-v2/`), with the differences
  in kind stated rather than averaged away: runner 1.1 GB weights + 0.81 GB KV
  in VRAM and 1.10 GB host RSS, against vLLM's 3.19 GiB bf16 weights, a 9.57
  GiB KV pool **preallocated by policy rather than need**, and 3.36 GB host RSS
  across its two processes — measuring only the process named `vllm` reports
  1.01 GB and understates it by more than half.

- **Write-side coverage: an interrupted client cannot take the server with it**
  (`tests/conformance/test_write_side.py`, 4 tests). A client that RSTs
  mid-stream, one that RSTs before reading a byte, ten in a row, and one that
  stops reading entirely — after each, the process is alive and both slots
  still serve.

  **Two things this deliberately does not claim.** The write *stall* — a
  `send()` that blocks until the 30 s `SO_SNDTIMEO` fires — cannot be produced
  in this harness: the suite model is capped by `n_ctx` at ~68 KB of SSE, and
  on loopback that fits in the socket buffers even with the client's
  `SO_RCVBUF` pinned to 1 KB (measured — the whole response is delivered to a
  client that never calls `recv()` once). For the same reason it does **not**
  gate `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)`: a build with the handler at `SIG_DFL` was
  constructed and passes all four, because the write completes before the peer
  resets. Both need a real model and a large context, which is a `scripts/`
  experiment rather than a conformance test, and is filed as such.

- **Anthropic prompt caching and replayed reasoning are now gated** (5 tests in
  `tests/conformance/test_messages.py`). Both behaviours already worked and
  neither had a test, which is the state in which a behaviour quietly stops
  being true.

  `cache_control` is accepted wherever the Anthropic SDK and Claude Code put it
  — on system blocks, on message content, and on a tool — because refusing the
  marker would make runner unusable with those clients rather than merely
  uncached. The matching *decision* is pinned too: runner still does not claim
  `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens`, since those carry
  Anthropic's semantics (`input_tokens` excludes what they cover) and filling
  them with runner's unrelated prefix-cache figures would misstate a client's
  accounting. That figure stays in `runner_telemetry`. **Owner call if it
  should change** — the test now says so out loud instead of the code saying it
  in a comment.

  Replayed `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks are accepted and dropped.
  The test that matters is not the 200 but the cost: via `count_tokens`, an
  assistant turn carrying a long thinking block counts **identically** to the
  same turn without one, with the same text sent as a `text` block as the
  control — without it the test would pass against a server that ignored
  content blocks entirely.

- **Fixed: `/v1/embeddings` refused every official OpenAI client.** The SDKs
  send `encoding_format: "base64"` by *default* and decode it themselves;
  runner answered `400 encoding_format must be float`, so `client.embeddings
  .create(...)` could not be called at all. base64 is now emitted as
  little-endian float32, spelled out byte by byte so the wire format does not
  depend on host endianness. `float` is unchanged and `dimensions` is still
  refused unless it equals the model's width.

  The conformance suite had a test **asserting the 400** — it pinned the bug in
  place, and every hand-written embeddings test passed because none of them sent
  the field the real client sends. It is replaced by a check that the base64
  payload decodes to the same vector as the float form, which merely accepting
  the field would not pass.

- **A second, independent client too: the Vercel AI SDK**
  (`tests/aisdk/smoke.mjs`, driven by `tests/conformance/test_ai_sdk.py`).
  `ai` + `@ai-sdk/openai` is what most local-model tooling actually uses — Cline,
  Continue, anything on Next.js — and it has its own request builder and stream
  parser, so it is a real second opinion rather than a restatement of the first.
  Eight cases: text, streamed text, streamed usage, a tool call, a two-turn tool
  round trip with the result replayed, `generateObject` typechecked against a
  zod schema, batched embeddings, and a typed error. All pass. Skipped unless
  `tests/aisdk/node_modules` exists, so CI gains no npm step.

- **The official OpenAI SDK now has conformance coverage**
  (`tests/conformance/test_openai_sdk.py`, 10 tests, skipped when the package is
  absent — the same rule `test_messages.py` applies to `anthropic`, so CI gains
  no network-installed dependency). It covers models, buffered and streamed
  chat, `stream_options.include_usage`, tool calls and the tool-result second
  turn, `json_schema` output, legacy completions, embeddings, and typed errors.
  The embeddings defect above was found by its first run.

- **A long prefill no longer blocks the other slots for its full length.** On a
  4-slot GPU server, a short request arriving during a 2,891-token prefill
  waited **26.2 s — 110x its 0.237 s solo time**. Prefill now gives the device
  turn back between chunks:

  | | long request | worst short during it | vs solo |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | before | 26.50 s | 26.17 s | 110x |
  | after | 27.01 s | **5.45 s** | **23x** |

  The remaining 5.4 s is the honest cost of fair interleaving, not a defect: a
  short request decodes 8 tokens and each queues behind one 64-token prefill
  chunk. Prefill itself pays 1.9%. CPU builds are unaffected — the device turn
  only exists where CUDA graph capture does.

  **Yielding the turn was not enough, and shipping it alone would have been a
  no-op.** `dev_mu` was a plain mutex, and a plain mutex is not a hand-off: the
  releasing thread is already on-CPU with its threadpool hot and re-acquires
  before the woken waiter is scheduled. The waiter lost 44 of 45 races and
  still waited 25.3 s. `sched_yield()` before retaking changed nothing. The
  turn is now a FIFO ticket turnstile, so giving it back means giving it up.
  `tests/test_sched_turn.c` guards the ordering by reproducing the barge —
  it fails against a plain-mutex build and passes against the turnstile.

- **The prefix cache stores to the divergence point, not to the end of the
  prompt.** Agent traffic is a system prompt, a tool list and a schema, then a
  request that differs. Publishing each turn whole held the shared block once
  per turn. Measured on Qwen2.5-7B with six sibling prompts over a ~2,300-token
  shared prefix:

  | | entries | bytes | evictions |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | before | 4 | 532.4 MB | 2 |
  | after | **1** | **133.1 MB** | **0** |

  Reuse is unchanged — every sibling reuses 2,314 of 2,321 tokens either way —
  so this is 4x less memory for the same work, and the two evictions it removes
  were the cache throwing away a genuinely shared block in order to store tails
  nobody shares.

  The tail past the divergence point is exactly the part another request has
  been *observed* not to share, and it is also the part a repeat of the same
  prompt recovers for free from its own slot via `engine_rewind`. Truncating is
  free in correctness terms for the same reason the existing half-budget cap
  is: a prefix of a prefix is still a valid prefix.

  The new conformance gate was **vacuous on its first version** and only caught
  it by checking: its five sibling tails were of different lengths, so one was
  a prefix of another and the pre-existing "strictly extends" branch collapsed
  them to one entry for a reason unrelated to this policy — it passed against a
  build with the policy compiled out. With equal-length tails that diverge
  early it now fails without the policy and passes with it.

- **A certified `cpu_cuda` claim does not hold at the documented token count,
  and the tool's default hides it. OWNER call.** Chasing the plan's "Qwen3-4B
  CPU/GPU divergence at token 24" turned up something broader.

  `docs/compatibility-program.md` states the contract as *"Exact 128-token
  identity is required between Runner CPU and GPU."* `scripts/cpu_cuda_check.py`
  defaults to **`--tokens 16`**. On Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M — which declares `cpu_cuda`
  and whose file matches the manifest's pinned sha256 — the two answers differ:

  | tokens | result |
  |---|---|
  | 16 (the default) | 5/5 identical |
  | 32 | 5/5 identical |
  | 48, 64, 96, 128 | **4/5** |

  **Pre-existing, not from this release's work**: the published `v0.1.5-alpha`
  build, rebuilt from the tag, gives the same 4/5. So the certification passes
  because the tool checks 16 tokens, not because the claim holds at 128.

  What it is *not*, measured: not the GPU split (both runs reach `G=36/36
  full=1`), not `RUNNER_MOE_EAGER=1` (5/5 with it set — and Qwen3-4B is dense
  anyway), not cross-request KV reuse (5/5 with `cache_prompt:false`), and not
  simply arithmetic — the failing prompt is byte-identical CPU vs GPU when run
  alone on a fresh server, and a reproduction matching the harness's request
  body exactly also gives 5/5. It is **intermittent on the GPU side** and so far
  reproduces only inside the tool's own process.

  Two things follow, and the first is not mine to decide: whether to re-certify
  Qwen3-4B, raise the tool's default to the documented 128, or amend the
  documented contract, is a **certification decision — surfaced, not taken**.
  The second is a plain tool bug: the report records `"gpu_split": null` even
  though the line is present in the log it reads, so a report cannot say what
  was actually certified — which is exactly what `read_split`'s own docstring
  says it exists to prevent.

- **A CPU server no longer serializes on a device turn it does not have.** The
  scheduler's `dev_mu` exists for one reason, stated in its own comment: a
  microbatch captures a CUDA graph on its lead sequence's stream, and any other
  launch in that context breaks the capture. So prefill, decode and any solo
  generation take turns. A **CPU** build has no capture and no shared device
  context — every `model_t` owns its activation scratch and its thread pool,
  and the weights are read-only — so the turn buys nothing there and costs a
  lot.

  Measured on Qwen2.5-7B, `--gpu off --parallel 4`, with a grammar-fast-forward
  request holding the turn for its whole generation: a plain request arriving
  during it waited **10.3 s against 4.8 s alone**, i.e. for the entire
  generation. After gating the turn on `m->gpu != NULL`: **4.3 s, 1.0x**. The
  constrained request itself goes 6.8 → 7.7 s, which is the correct trade — it
  is now sharing the box instead of monopolising it.

  Untouched on the GPU path, where the capture hazard is real. And the bigger
  half is still open and now says so in the code: `sched_generate` holds the
  turn for a whole speculative generation rather than per forward, so on a GPU
  one `--draft` slot still stalls every other slot for its full length. Taking
  the turn per forward needs `engine_generate` to call a hook around each one.

- **Not done: the per-forward device turn on GPU.** `sched_generate` holds
  `dev_mu` for a whole speculative generation, so on a GPU one `--draft` slot
  stalls every other slot for its full length. The fix was built — a
  `engine_set_device_turn()` hook the scheduler hands down, wrapping each of
  the five forwards a speculative round issues, deliberately per-call rather
  than per-round because that loop exits through several `goto`s and a missed
  release is a deadlock — and then **reverted, because two measurements
  disagreed**:

  | run | whole-generation hold | per-forward hold |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | worst concurrent request 3.0x solo | 2.1x |
  | 2 | 2.3x | 3.0x |

  Contradictory results are not evidence, and the change costs a lock/unlock
  per decoded token on the hot path. What defeated the measurement is that a
  schema-constrained generation completes its object and stops early, so no
  configuration available here produced a speculative generation long enough
  for the hold to dominate — which is exactly the case the theory is about (an
  unbounded hold versus one bounded by a single forward). A conclusive test
  needs either a schema that does not self-terminate or a real draft/target
  pair, neither of which is on this box. Patch and numbers filed.

- **Prefix snapshots survive a restart (`runner.prefix.v1`).** A warm prefix
  cache is worth minutes of prefill and it died with the process.
  `prefix_cache_save()` / `prefix_cache_load()` write it to a file and read it
  back, so a restarted server answers the first agent request at fork speed.

  The trust question is the whole design, and it is answered by refusal rather
  than by adaptation. A snapshot is raw KV bytes: installing one that does not
  belong to this model does not error, it produces fluent wrong output — the
  same hazard `engine_prefix_reuse` was built around, now with a file as the
  surface. So the file carries the engine's `model_key`, which already binds
  the weights, the geometry, the tokenizer, the context length and the KV
  element type, and **every entry whose key does not match is dropped, not
  fitted**. The file is also checked for a magic, a length-consistent body and
  a payload digest before any of it is believed, and a failure discards the
  whole load rather than keeping the part that parsed — a partial load of a
  corrupt file is the worst outcome, because it looks like success. It is
  opt-in with an explicit path and no discovery: a cache directory someone else
  can write is a way to hand this process someone else's KV.

  `tests/test_prefix_persist.c` is fifteen checks and most of them are
  refusals: a foreign model key, a mismatched entry width, a file that is not
  ours, a truncated file, a single flipped byte. The round trip is checked by
  **content** — a fresh engine must fork the reloaded snapshot — because a
  save/load pair that wrote zeros would still keep the entry count.

  Landed only after a detour worth recording. The test segfaulted 8 times out
  of 8 at `-O2` and above while passing at `-O0`, `-O1`, and under ASan at both
  — the signature of corruption ASan cannot see. It was **not the feature**:
  `engine_init` calls `free(e->hist)` on entry (its comment says "e must be
  zeroed"), and the test declared `engine e;` on the stack uninitialized, so
  each init freed a wild pointer. `engine e = {0}` and it is 5/5 clean at full
  optimization. The feature was reverted once on the strength of that crash
  before the cause was known, which was the right call at the time and the
  wrong conclusion.

- **Phase 8: the 8k→32k retrieval gate — a q8 cache does not cost recall.**
  Needle-in-a-haystack on Qwen2.5-7B: a unique fact planted at 10%, 50% and 90%
  depth in a filler context, two codes per depth, scored on exact digits.

  | KV | context | prompt tokens | recalled |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | f16 | 8k | ~5,237 | 6/6 |
  | f16 | 32k | ~20,817 | 6/6 |
  | q8_0 | 8k | ~5,237 | 6/6 |
  | q8_0 | 32k | ~20,817 | **6/6** |

  Together with the throughput row below — q8 costs 0.9% prefill and 0.7%
  decode — the case for a q8 cache is that it halves the KV for no measured
  loss on either axis. Whether it becomes a default is still an owner call, and
  the clu item asking for that decision is unchanged.

  The scorer was wrong first and reported 4/9 for answers that were all
  correct: it demanded the hyphens in `62-05-31` from a prompt that asked for
  "the digits only". Scoring on digits is the fix. A gate that marks correct
  answers wrong is the same class of defect as one that cannot fail.

- **Phase 8: q8 KV attention is essentially free.** Measured on the now
  uncontended MIG slice, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M, 512-token prompt and 256
  generated, full offload (28/28 layers) in every row:

  | KV | context | prefill | decode |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | f16 | 4096 / 16384 / 32768 | 129.2 / 129.3 / 129.3 tok/s | 70.51 / 70.44 / 70.59 tok/s |
  | q8_0 | 4096 / 16384 / 32768 | 128.1 / 128.2 / 128.1 tok/s | 70.06 / 69.73 / 70.12 tok/s |

  **0.9% of prefill and 0.7% of decode**, for half the cache. What this does
  *not* show, and the reason the context column is flat: `--bench-json`
  generates 256 tokens whatever the context *capacity* is, so the cache stays
  nearly empty and this measures the q8 attention kernels, not decode against a
  full 32k window. The long-context half is the separate 8k→32k retrieval gate,
  still open.

- **Phase 7 measurements: the fork bottleneck is not the mutex, and an SWA
  snapshot is ~3x larger than it needs to be.** Neither is a code change here;
  both correct a premise the plan was carrying.

  **The "snapshot/fork mutex as a scaling bottleneck" names the wrong mutex.**
  Measured on Qwen2.5-7B with a 2,310-token shared prefix and `--parallel 4`:
  one fork takes 0.095 s, four concurrent forks take 0.44 s in a clean
  staircase (0.385 / 0.422 / 0.422 / 0.437) — fully serialized. Moving the
  132 MB snapshot copy out from under `PFX.mu`, with a pin/dead refcount so
  eviction cannot free an entry mid-copy, was implemented and measured:
  **0.433 s. No improvement.** So it was reverted rather than shipped as
  unmeasured complexity.

  The real serializer is one line up in `completion.c`: `engine_prefix_reuse`
  runs **inside `sched_prefill_begin()/sched_prefill_end()`**, the device turn.
  The comment there justifies it — "on CUDA it issues a forward" — and that is
  true of exactly one single-token forward needed to break the device KV
  mirror. The other 132 MB is a host memcpy holding a device lock. Confirmed on
  the CPU path too, where there is no device work at all and four forks still
  take 4.2x one. The fix is to take the turn around the sync forward alone,
  which needs `engine_prefix_reuse` split into a lookup half and a copy half;
  filed rather than attempted, because a fork that lands wrong produces a
  plausible wrong answer rather than an error.

  **SWA prefixes, measured separately as the plan asked.** gemma-4-E4B has 42
  layers of which **35 are sliding-window with a 512-token window**, and
  `prefix_cache_entry_bytes` stores the full prefix length for every
  KV-owning layer regardless. For a 2,310-token prefix that is 2,310 rows per
  sliding layer where only 512 can ever be attended to. Storing the window
  instead would take the snapshot from 42x2310 row-equivalents to
  7x2310 + 35x512 — **2.85x smaller**, which is also 2.85x more prefixes inside
  the same 512 MB budget. Filed: the KV layout is absolute-indexed, so this is
  a placement change rather than a smaller `memcpy`.

- **`server_run` could not run twice, and a SIGTERM could fail to wake
  `accept()`.** RNR-019's remaining half was "de-globalise `SV`". Rather than
  start from the shape, the property was written down first: *a server must be
  able to start, serve, stop and start again in one process.* A global
  initialized once and torn down once can hide an asymmetry forever, because
  nothing ever asks the state to come back. `tests/test_server_restart.c` asks,
  twice — and found two defects, neither of which any existing test could see.

  **The state had no lifetime.** `q.shutdown`, `shutdown` and `load_cancel` are
  raised during teardown and never lowered, and `reaper_started` stayed true
  next to a `reaper_th` whose thread had already been joined. A second
  `server_run` therefore listened, accepted connections, and generated nothing:
  every slot worker saw a shut-down queue and exited at once. `server_run` now
  resets the state at entry, as the documented counterpart of the teardown at
  the bottom.

  **A SIGTERM could leave the server parked in `accept()`.** The handler closed
  the listener and the comment said that "wakes accept()". It does not — a
  blocked `accept()` is woken by the signal only in the thread the signal was
  *delivered to*, and a process may deliver SIGTERM to any thread that has it
  unblocked: a slot worker, the decode thread, the TTL reaper. Observed
  directly in `/proc`: the accept thread sat in `inet_csk_accept` long after
  the handler had run and closed the fd. `shutdown(fd, SHUT_RDWR)` now precedes
  the `close()`; both are async-signal-safe. This is a **plausible but
  unproven** explanation for the `test_signal_during_startup` sighting above —
  "server survived a SIGTERM" is exactly the symptom, and its rarity matches
  delivery usually landing on the main thread — but it was never reproduced, so
  the link is offered, not claimed.

  Both fixes are demonstrated load-bearing: without the reset the second cycle
  fails with *"no worker answered a completion"*; without `shutdown()` the
  first cycle hangs in `pthread_join`. The gate had to be strengthened to show
  the first — its initial version asked for `/v1/models`, which
  `accept_fastpath` answers on the accept path with no worker involved, so it
  passed against the very bug it was written for. A gate that cannot fail is
  worse than none.

  What this is **not**: `SV` is still one global, so two servers in one process
  would still share it. What changed is that its lifetime is now explicit and
  its init/teardown symmetry is tested. Threading a per-instance context
  through six translation units is the remaining half, filed rather than done —
  nothing needs two servers in a process today, and the defects above were the
  part that was actually costing something.

- **The `test_signal_during_startup` flake did not reproduce, and the test now
  records enough to chase the next one.** It was seen once on 2026-08-02 at the
  2 ms delay and estimated at "~1 in 20 runs" from that single sighting — which
  is the same mistake the earlier speculation flake was corrected for, since
  one occurrence establishes no rate. Not reproduced in **960 spawns**: 240 on
  an idle box, 240 with 24 spinners loading it, 120 on the pre-Phase-5 binary
  and 120 on the current one, plus 20 consecutive whole-suite runs (307/307
  each), whose 240 in-suite spawns are included. Rule of three puts the 95%
  upper bound on the per-spawn rate at 0.31%, just under the 0.42% the original
  estimate implies.

  A guess that Phase 5's faster loads had shortened the window was **wrong**
  and measured as wrong: startup to `listening` is 2.7 ms before and 2.4 ms
  after, because the test fixture's vocabulary is trivial and the parse saving
  needs a real one.

  Left open rather than closed — absence over 960 spawns is not proof of a
  fix. What changed is that the test no longer discards the survivor's output,
  so a future occurrence says how far startup had got instead of only that it
  happened.

- **A context that fits but evicts weights now says so.** Refusing a context
  that cannot fit is loud and correct — `-c 1000000` names the 131072 MB of KV
  it would need and exits non-zero. A context that merely *costs layers* was
  accepted in silence, and the bill arrived as throughput: `-c 32768` on an 8B
  model takes decode from 66.5 to 8.6 tok/s on an 8 GB card because a 4.3 GB
  cache pushed layers onto the host. The split line already reported the
  placement; nothing connected it to the context that caused it.

  ```
  gpu-split: budget=6.34GB fixed=0.91GB G=26/28 full=0 used=6.28GB
  note: the KV cache for ctx 32768 is 1.74 GB on the device and 2 of 28 layers
        ran out of room because of it — a smaller -c or --kv q8 (about half)
        moves layers back
  ```

  It fires only when the KV is a large share of what is on the device, because
  a partial split for any other reason — a model simply bigger than the card —
  is not a trade the user can take back by lowering `-c`. Verified on three
  cases: the one above fires, a full offload is silent, and Qwen3-Coder-30B at
  18 of 48 layers on a 7.6 GB budget is silent. Acting on it works and the
  note then stops: `--kv q8` on the same run recovers a layer (26/28 → 27/28)
  and goes quiet. Written host-side rather than into the CUDA split banner, so
  it covers Metal too and leaves `cuda.c` untouched.

- **A filed prefix-cache "inefficiency" was a misread telemetry field.** The
  note from the flake work said that after a cancellation plus concurrent
  traffic a sequential request "never forks at all — deterministic, not a
  race", and filed it as a possible caching inefficiency. Measured: sequential
  requests after exactly that sequence **do** fork, 930 and 931 tokens.

  The zeros that prompted the note are on the *concurrent* requests, and they
  do not mean the prefix went unused — those requests report
  `prompt_cached_tokens` 927 with `prompt_eval_tokens` **1**. The slot's own KV
  already held the prefix, so `engine_prefix_reuse` declined to fork: its gate
  is `best > r.keep`, and forking when the snapshot holds no more than the slot
  does would copy identical rows over themselves. `prompt_forked_tokens` is the
  subset that came from the *shared snapshot*, not the amount reused.

  `test_agent_runtime_composition.py` now asserts the property that actually
  matters to a caller — every concurrent request reused the prefix rather than
  re-prefilling it — alongside the existing "at least one forked", and its
  comment no longer states the wrong claim as fact.

- **Apertus generated gibberish, and `0.1.5-alpha` shipped it that way.** The
  architecture landed in `d7eda52` with the honest caveat that it was "not yet
  verified against a real checkpoint — the shape is right, the numbers are
  unconfirmed". They were wrong. The first run against
  `Apertus-8B-Instruct-2509-Q4_K_M` produced
  *"The capital of Switzerland isus ROIgg Sylosl Suombe…"* where llama.cpp on
  the same file produces *"Bern, which is also the country's largest city"*.

  `ggml_xielu` does not pass the file's parameters to `op_xielu`. It transforms
  them when it builds the node — `alpha_p` becomes `softplus(alpha_p)`, and
  `alpha_n` becomes `beta + softplus(alpha_n)` — and only the transformed
  values reach the activation. Runner transcribed `op_xielu`, the leaf
  function, and fed it the raw values. **Read the graph, not the op**, which is
  the second time this exact lesson has been recorded here (the E-series PLE
  injection point was the first).

  It hid well. `softplus` is the identity above ~20 to float precision, and
  most of Apertus-8B's alphas are in the tens or hundreds — layer 0 has
  `alpha_p` 166.0, which needs no correction at all. The middle layers are
  where it bites: layer 15 has `alpha_n` **0.00296** against an effective
  **1.19463**, a factor of 403. Folded at load time, once per layer, so the
  hot path is unchanged.

  Now verified rather than asserted. The residual disagreement with llama.cpp
  is **below the model's own noise floor**: a max log-probability delta of
  0.4148 nats cross-engine against 0.4596 nats for runner-versus-runner under
  a KV precision change, with 7 of 16 divergences landing on a tie. So Apertus
  carries `load` and `chat` but not `greedy_reference`, for the same measured
  reason as gemma-4-26B and gemma-4-E4B. Evidence:
  `tests/compatibility/out/sensitivity-apertus-2026-08-03.json` and
  `divergence-apertus-2026-08-03.json`.

- **Apertus tokenizer: 3 of 721 → 0 of 721.** The three known divergences
  (नमस्ते, हिन्दी, สวัสดี) were combining-mark sequences, and the cause was a
  correct fix applied one regex too widely. `cp_mark` exists because treating
  every non-symbol codepoint above ASCII as a letter glued Indic and Thai vowel
  signs into `\p{L}+` runs — right for `llama-bpe`, `qwen2` and `smollm`, whose
  regexes all spell a plain `\p{L}+`. **`tekken` is the exception**: it carries
  `\p{M}` in both letter classes,

  ```
  [^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?[\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lm}\p{Lo}\p{M}]*[\p{Ll}\p{Lm}\p{Lo}\p{M}]+
  ```

  so a virama or a Thai vowel sign has to stay *inside* the run. The comments
  on `cp_letter_upperish` / `cp_letter_lowerish` had spelled the class with
  `\p{M}` in it all along; only the code disagreed. Marks now count as letters
  in the tekken split alone. Verified against the HuggingFace references:
  Apertus 0/721, and Mistral-Nemo — the other `tekken` model — still 0/721,
  with Qwen2.5-7B and gemma-4-E4B spot-checked at 0/721 to confirm the other
  families are untouched.

- **The merge loops were quadratic in the length of one segment.** Phase 5
  asked for shared *tokenized* prefixes, on the theory that re-tokenizing the
  same system prompt every request was the cost. Measuring first found
  something worse: tokenization was **O(n²)**, and a cache would have hidden
  it rather than fixed it.

  Both merge loops rescanned every adjacent pair after every merge. That is
  fine when the loop is handed a word at a time, which is what a GPT-2 style
  pre-tokenizer does — but the SentencePiece path never splits at all, and
  gemma-4's BPE path splits only on newline runs, so **one long line is one
  unit**. On 4,000 characters of prose in a single line:

  | tokenizer | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | gemma-4 (26B, E4B) | 71.6 ms | 0.87 ms (**82×**) |
  | Lucie-7B | 30.5 ms | 0.44 ms (69×) |
  | Teuken-7B | 30.0 ms | 0.56 ms (54×) |
  | salamandra-7B | 31.0 ms | 1.28 ms (24×) |
  | TildeOpen-30b | 30.8 ms | 1.70 ms (18×) |
  | EuroLLM-9B | 31.6 ms | 2.13 ms (15×) |
  | Qwen2.5 / Qwen3-Coder / gpt-oss / OLMo-2 / granite | 0.31–0.34 ms | 0.27–0.30 ms (1.1×) |

  Nine of the fourteen models on the bench box were affected, including **five
  of the six certified European models**. It is genuinely quadratic — `ms/n²`
  is flat at 4.5 across a 30× range of input — so 16,000 characters on one
  line took **940 ms** on gemma-4, single-threaded, before a token is
  generated, on every request. End to end, a warm one-token request with a
  4,000-character single-line prompt on gemma-4-E4B goes **110 ms → 39 ms**.

  The fix is a priority queue of merge candidates, O(n log n). It must be
  **exact** — ids are load-bearing, and every `greedy_reference` certification
  is a claim about output that shifting one id would invalidate — so ordering
  reproduces the old scan exactly: best key first, leftmost on a tie, because
  the old loops compared with a strict `>` / `<` while walking left to right.
  Verified byte-identical against the previous implementation on all 14 local
  models over 1,965 records × 4 flag combinations = **110,040 comparisons**
  per model, covering prose, source, JSON, CJK, Devanagari, Thai combining
  marks, emoji ZWJ sequences and adversarial no-space runs.

  It did not start out exact, and the harness is why that was caught: an
  absorbed symbol keeps its length and its `next` pointer, so a queued
  candidate naming a symbol that had itself been swallowed as somebody's
  right-hand side still passed the liveness test and merged a symbol no longer
  in the list. On EuroLLM that turned `"  index."` into three ids instead of
  two, in 1,100 of 7,860 dumps. Absorbed symbols now have their length zeroed.
  `tests/test_tokenizer_merge.c` is the permanent gate: `tok_merge_force()`
  runs both paths on one binary and requires identical ids across every
  committed vocabulary fixture, the 721-line corpus and the adversarial
  shapes. Confirmed it fails on the pre-fix build.

  Short segments keep the rescan (`MERGE_QUEUE_MIN`), because the first
  measured version was **20% slower** on Qwen2.5 and gpt-oss while being 82×
  faster on gemma-4 — a queue costs more than re-reading three pairs. With the
  threshold and one allocation instead of four, the short-word models come out
  ~1.1× faster rather than slower.

  Also measured and **declined**: caching compiled schemas. A realistic strict
  tool envelope parses and compiles in 10 µs (3 tools) to 35 µs (12 tools),
  against requests that run for hundreds of milliseconds. A cache would add a
  key, an eviction policy and a lifetime hazard — the `snode` is live for the
  whole generation — to save 0.003% of a request.

- **Phase 5 — a reservation is a budget for the server, not for one slot.**
  `--reserve-vram P` with `-c 0` auto-fits the context to whatever the
  reservation leaves after the weights. Every slot ran that arithmetic alone,
  which billed **the weights N times and the KV cache once** — backwards on
  both halves, and the KV half is the dangerous direction. Measured on
  Qwen2.5-7B, `--reserve-vram 40 --parallel 4 -c 0` on a 25.37 GB device
  (10.15 GB budget): all four slots independently auto-fit to 32768 and each
  allocated its own 1.88 GB cache, for **12.47 GB — 23% over the
  reservation**. The only thing that kept it from being far worse is that the
  train context capped the window; a model with a longer train context would
  have overrun by close to the slot count.

  `model_params` gains `n_seq`, and the auto-fit now divides the KV and the
  activation head by it while still counting one weights copy. Same
  configuration after: context 19139, **9.25 GB, inside the budget**. A
  single slot and the one-shot CLI are unchanged (still 32768).

  Worth recording because it was measured rather than assumed: setting `n_seq`
  only for the slots `server_run` creates made it **worse, not better** —
  14.75 GB. Slot 0 is the model `main.c` preloaded, so it kept sizing itself
  alone at 32768 while slots 1–3 chose 19139, and the CUDA shared-weight
  registry keys on context — so the disagreement forced a *second* 4.7 GB
  upload of the same weights. The flag is set before the first load.

- **Phase 5 — one parse per file, not one per slot.** `model_t` fused the
  weight side and the per-sequence side, and the header had said so for a
  while: *"the struct itself is not yet split into two types… the sharing was
  pushed into the backend first, where the duplication actually cost
  gigabytes."* The host side was never done, and the bill was not the weights
  — those are mmap'd and the page cache already dedupes them — it was the
  **parse**.

  Measured on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M, `--serve -c 512 --gpu off`, touched
  host memory after startup:

  | slots | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | 51.3 MB | 51.2 MB |
  | 2 | 81.0 MB | 51.3 MB |
  | 4 | 140.3 MB | 51.4 MB |

  **29.7 MB per extra slot → 87 KB.** Reading the file's own metadata
  accounts for 15.3 MB of what was being repeated: `tokenizer.ggml.tokens` and
  `tokenizer.ggml.merges` are 303,454 strings, each its own `malloc`, re-made
  for every slot — for a vocabulary the slots **never read**, because they
  share one tokenizer built from slot 0's file. The rest is the f32 conversion
  of every norm and bias, the tensor directory, and the pages each duplicate
  mapping faults in separately.

  `model_load` now splits at the line where it stops reading the file and
  starts sizing buffers: `model_bind_weights` produces the immutable half,
  `model_alloc_runtime` the per-sequence half. The immutable half lives in a
  refcounted record keyed on path plus file identity (size, inode, mtime,
  ctime) — a model rebuilt on disk between two loads must not be served out of
  the previous parse — plus the only two parameters the bind phase reads.
  Every `model_t` sharing a record holds **aliasing pointers**, so field
  access is unchanged and only ownership moved; that is what kept this out of
  `cuda.c` and `metal.m` entirely. It is deliberately the same shape
  `cuda.c` has used for the device upload since the MoE work.

  What is **not** shared, and why: the rope tables. YaRN auto-extension keys
  off the requested context and phi3 picks its LongRoPE factor set the same
  way, so two slots of one file with different `-c` legitimately want
  different tables — they are built after the seam and stay per-instance,
  along with the KV cache, all activation scratch, the thread pool, the VRAM
  lease and the expert placement array.

  `tests/test_shared_weights.c` already checked that two instances agree, stay
  isolated, and free exactly once in any order. All three still pass on a
  build that copies the whole file per instance, so they could not have caught
  a regression here — the test now also asserts the aliasing directly, and
  that a load differing in a weight-side parameter gets its own parse.
  Verified the four new assertions fail on a sharing-blind build.

  Also: `make test-shared-asan` was **red before this change and unrelated to
  it** — 5,280 bytes in 12 allocations, every one below `cuInit` in
  `libcuda.so`, reported identically at the previous commit. A leak gate that
  always fails is a leak gate nobody reads, and this is precisely the change
  it exists to check, so `tests/lsan.supp` suppresses that library (not a
  wildcard: a leak in runner's own frames during a CUDA call is still
  reported). The gate is green and reports the suppression matching exactly
  those 12 allocations.

- **RNR-019 — `server.c` is seven files instead of one.** 4,702 lines
  combining socket portability, HTTP parsing, routing, request validation,
  three protocol translations, SSE streaming, model registry and swap
  lifecycle, thread queues, continuous batching and shutdown. Now:

  | file | lines | owns |
  |---|---|---|
  | `http.c` | 211 | sockets, request parsing, response writing |
  | `registry.c` | 324 | model residency, swap, TTL reaper, admission queue |
  | `scheduler.c` | 343 | the continuous-batching decode thread |
  | `completion.c` | 1,757 | the generation loop and all three wire framings |
  | `api_responses.c` | 414 | Responses request → chat |
  | `api_anthropic.c` | 495 | Anthropic Messages request → chat |
  | `server.c` | 1,135 | routes, HTTP dispatch, capabilities, listener, shutdown |

  Every extraction is a **verbatim text move** — linkage is the only edit —
  each verified by comparing the multiset of non-comment lines before and
  after, and each gated on `make test` plus the 307-case conformance suite
  before the next one started. That gate is the reason this work waited: the
  suite had a ~30% flaky test until 0.1.5 and could not have told a broken
  refactor from a fired flake.

  Two of the seams are genuinely narrow and one is not, which is worth being
  precise about. `scheduler.h` is six functions and `SCH` is fully private —
  `sched_shutdown` was the only outside reference, so it moved too.
  `completion.h` is six declarations, because the routes reached the whole
  generation-and-framing complex through `run_completion` and nothing else.
  `api.h` is three. But `server_int.h` exposes the `SV` global as a declared
  `server_state` type rather than hiding it: that is the minimum needed for
  these to be separate translation units at all, and **de-globalising `SV`
  into a context threaded down from `server_run` is the rest of the finding**,
  a behavioural change rather than a move, deliberately not attempted here.

  Two things found on the way. `test_bind.c` — the source-text gate on the
  loopback-only bind — would have been quietly hollowed out: it asserted
  `typedef SOCKET sock_t;` appears in `server.c`, which is no longer where
  that lives, and a check left pointing at a file the code moved out of passes
  vacuously. Each check now follows the code it guards, and the
  forbidden-resolver scan (`getaddrinfo`, `inet_pton`, `INADDR_ANY`,
  `SO_BINDTODEVICE`…) was widened to the new transport and admission files,
  which are the more natural place to smuggle in an escape hatch. Confirmed
  each still fails by planting the forbidden text.

  And the scheduler is `scheduler.c`, not `sched.c`, because `src/` goes on
  the include path with `-I` for every test target and `-I` directories are
  searched **before** the system ones — so `src/sched.h` silently shadowed the
  standard `<sched.h>`, which `<pthread.h>` includes. Every test that reached
  `pthread.h` got the batching scheduler instead and failed with
  `unknown type 'slot_t'` inside a system header. `scripts/check-generated.py`
  now fails the build if any `src/*.h` collides with a C or POSIX header name;
  the symptom is a wall of type errors in a file nobody edited and the cause
  is invisible from there.

- **RNR-018 — `runner.h` is thirteen module headers instead of one.** The core
  header declared the whole engine: GGUF internals, the tokenizer maps, the
  full mutable `model_t`, the backend contract, the VRAM registry, the sampler,
  the JSON and schema validators, chat templates, the tool-call envelope and
  the generation engine — 1,291 lines visible to every translation unit and
  every test. `model.c` could reach the HTTP-facing tool envelope; `sample.c`
  could reach the GGUF tensor directory. Nothing did, but nothing stopped it.

  Now: `fp16.h`, `quants.h`, `gguf.h`, `tpool.h`, `tokenizer.h`, `model.h`,
  `vramreg.h`, `gpu.h`, `sample.h`, `jsonmode.h`, `schema.h`, `template.h`,
  `engine.h`. `runner.h` remains and includes all thirteen, so every consumer
  that wants the whole engine — the CLI, the server, the GPU backends, the
  tests — keeps one include and sees exactly what it saw before. Twelve
  single-module translation units now include only their own boundary:

  | TU | module headers visible |
  |---|---|
  | `sample.c`, `jsonmode.c`, `vramreg.c` | 1 of 13 |
  | `gguf.c`, `tokenizer.c`, `schema.c` | 2 |
  | `quants.c`, `template.c`, `quantize.c` | 3 |
  | `gpu_none.c` | 6 |
  | `model.c` | 7 |
  | `engine.c` | 12 |

  The split is a **verbatim text move**: every declaration was checked to
  appear exactly once across the thirteen files and to be identical to the
  original, by comparing the multiset of non-comment lines before and after.
  No signature, type or comment was reworded — a move can be audited, a
  rewrite has to be re-reviewed.

  `src/cuda.c` and `src/metal.m` deliberately still include `runner.h`: they
  are owned by the CUDA box, and one of them has CRLF line endings, so
  touching them here would have handed that machine a whitespace conflict for
  no gain.

  Two things this does **not** buy, stated because it would be easy to assume
  otherwise. It does not speed up builds: `make` compiles all sixteen sources
  in a single command with no object files, so header granularity has never
  affected rebuild cost. And it does not split immutable weights from
  per-sequence state inside `model_t`, which is the other half of RNR-018 and
  a real interface change rather than a move. `Makefile` gained
  `HDR = $(wildcard src/*.h)`, replacing 26 hardcoded `src/runner.h`
  prerequisites — without it the split would have quietly stopped a change to
  any of the new headers from triggering a rebuild.

## v0.1.5-alpha — 2026-08-02

- **Generalized MoE router.** The router was hardcoded to softmax + top-k +
  renormalize. It now carries the knobs the Llama-4, DeepSeek-V3 and GroveMoE
  families need, transcribed from llama.cpp's `build_moe_ffn`:
  `expert_gating_func` (softmax | sigmoid | softmax-over-selected-weights |
  sqrt-softplus), `exp_probs_b` (a bias applied to **selection only** — the
  weights still come from the unbiased probabilities, which is the point of
  DeepSeek's aux-loss-free balancing), group-limited top-k
  (`expert_group_count` / `expert_group_used_count`), `expert_weights_scale`
  and `expert_weights_norm`. Also picked up from the reference: the
  renormalization divisor is clamped to the smallest normal fp16, so a
  degenerate all-zero row cannot divide by zero — the old code had no clamp.

  Every default reproduces the previous path bit-for-bit: Qwen3-Coder-30B,
  gpt-oss-20b and gemma-4-26B-A4B are byte-identical across the change.
  **CUDA refuses rather than approximates** — `k_moe_route` is softmax + top-k
  with no bias input, so a model needing any non-default knob falls back to the
  host naming the knob.

  Gated by `tests/test_moe_router.c`, one dense-oracle fixture per knob,
  compared in **logit** space. That distinction is not academic:
  `expert_weights_norm` and all three alternative gating functions pass a
  *text* comparison on a binary that does not implement them at all, because a
  2x change in the FFN contribution often does not move a greedy argmax.

- **The flaky composition test is fixed, and it was not the assertion everyone
  thought.** `test_schema_batch_prefix_cancel_and_speculation_compose` failed
  about three runs in ten under whole-suite load and passed every time in
  isolation. It was read as the speculative-acceptance assertion — both render
  as `assert 0 > 0` — and an earlier fix hardened that one. The failing line
  was `prompt_forked_tokens > 0`, the prefix-cache fork.

  Root cause, measured rather than inferred: **a resident prefix can be forked
  by at most `parallel` requests at once.** With `--parallel 2`, four
  concurrent requests sharing a warm prefix report forks `[66, 67, 0, 0]`. The
  test issues *three* concurrent requests — a cancellation plus both schema
  ones — and required both schema responses to fork, which holds only when the
  cancellation loses the race. A coin flip, and the ~1-in-3 rate follows from
  it directly.

  It now asserts that at least one concurrent request forked: the shared prefix
  survived poisoning, cancellation and concurrency. Twenty whole-suite runs
  with no occurrence of this failure, against a 0.08% chance of that if the
  original rate remained.

  Two things found on the way, both filed rather than folded in: after this
  sequence a *sequential* request never forks at all — deterministic, not a
  race, and a possible caching inefficiency; and `test_signal_during_startup`
  has its own much rarer flake (~1 in 20), previously masked by this one.

- **Socket errors are reported through the right platform channel.** A failed
  bind printed `strerror(errno)`, which on Windows is simply the wrong source —
  Winsock reports through `WSAGetLastError`, so a genuine bind failure printed
  "Success" or a stale unrelated error, which is worse than printing no reason.
  `sock_errstr()` now sits beside the other socket shims: `strerror(errno)` on
  POSIX, `FormatMessage` on Winsock with a numeric fallback. `listen()` reports
  a reason too, where it previously reported none at all.

- **First published vLLM row on the agent-torture matrix.** Same 100-case
  matrix, same model (SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct), same box: **Runner 100/100,
  vLLM 0.26.0 20/100**, every vLLM failure in the `protocol` category. Recorded
  with its deviations stated rather than buried — it is the full 100-case
  matrix, not the 12-case subset the earlier rows used, so it is not comparable
  to the published `12/12 vs 5/12`; and vLLM ran on CUDA against the fp16
  checkpoint while Runner ran on CPU against the Q4_K_M GGUF.
  Evidence: `tests/torture/results/2026-08-02-smollm2-1.7b-vllm/`.

  Getting vLLM to start took three attempts, and the reasons are themselves the
  comparison: torch/triton JIT-compile at startup and needed a C compiler this
  box does not have; then flashinfer needed full CUDA toolkit headers, also
  absent. That chain — a C compiler, a CUDA toolkit and an ~8 GB Python
  environment before the first token — is what "one file to ship" is measured
  against.

  **LM Studio remains unrun**: it is a GUI desktop application whose CLI
  requires the installed app, with no headless server install.

- **Apertus (`apertus`) is admitted: ungated MLP plus xIELU.** Its FFN has no
  `ffn_gate` — it is up → xIELU → down — so the gate tensor became optional
  for the ungated activation and stays required for every other dense arch.
  xIELU is transcribed from ggml's `op_xielu`: `alpha_p*x² + beta*x` above
  zero, `(expm1(min(x, eps)) - x)*alpha_n + beta*x` at or below. Its four
  parameters are read per layer, and from **un-prefixed** keys — llama.cpp
  spells them `xielu.alpha_n`, not `apertus.xielu.alpha_n` — accepting either
  a scalar shared by all layers or a per-layer array.

  Runner already had Apertus's `tekken` tokenizer and chat template; this is
  the forward pass, so the EU-column Apache-2.0 blocker is now down to
  verifying against a real checkpoint.

  **CUDA refuses**: the dense FFN encoder always issues a gate matvec and
  there is no xIELU kernel, so it runs on CPU with a message saying so.
  Gated by `tests/test_apertus.py`, which compares identity xIELU parameters
  (`alpha_p = alpha_n = 0`, `beta = 1`, making it the identity map) against
  real ones — a build ignoring the parameters produces the same output for
  both. The previous binary refuses the architecture outright.

- **Shared always-on expert (Qwen2-MoE / DeepSeek) is supported.** It was
  refused at load. A dense FFN runs over the same normed input the router saw
  and is summed into the routed output; Qwen2-MoE additionally scales it by
  sigmoid of a scalar router (llama.cpp writes that sigmoid as `silu(x)/x`),
  DeepSeek has no router tensor and adds it unscaled. Both shapes are handled,
  and the width falls back to the routed expert width exactly as the reference
  does. The branch is added at the call sites rather than inside `moe_ffn`, so
  the routed path is untouched — Qwen3-Coder-30B, gpt-oss and gemma-4-26B-A4B
  are byte-identical across the change.

  **CUDA refuses**: the routed kernels write the FFN output and nothing adds a
  second dense branch, so a shared-expert model runs on CPU with a message
  saying why.

  Gated against the dense oracle with the routed experts zeroed, so the output
  can only match if the shared branch ran exactly once — ignoring it collapses
  the FFN to zero, adding it twice doubles it. The gated variant's router
  weight is zero, making the gate `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`, with the shared FFN
  doubled to compensate: it only comes out right if the gate is really applied.
  The previous binary refuses both fixtures outright, which is the negative
  control.

- **Llama-4 attention knobs: NoPE and the position-dependent attention
  temperature.** Every `no_rope_layer_step`-th layer skips rope entirely, and
  on *those same layers* — it is the else-branch of the rope test in
  llama.cpp's llama4 graph, not a separate pass — Q is scaled by
  `log(floor((pos + offset) / floor_scale) + 1) * scale + 1`. Both default off,
  and Qwen2.5-7B, gemma-4-E4B and gpt-oss are byte-identical across the change.
  CPU and CUDA both implement it, so the two backends cannot diverge; the
  multi-sequence batch path declines a NoPE model instead, because it keeps
  positions on the device and would have to scale with the wrong factor — the
  caller then decodes sequentially, the retreat it already takes for a bad
  index.

  Gated by `tests/test_attn_knobs.py` reading the activation trace, because
  greedy text sees none of this: all four fixtures generate byte-identical
  output while their layer-0 Q rows plainly differ. Two of the three checks
  fail on a knob-blind binary, so the gate can fail.

  One check exists to stop a "fix": the temperature is **exactly 1.0 below
  position 8191**, since `floor(pos / 8192)` is 0 there and `log(1) = 0`. That
  reads as a dead knob and matches the reference.

- **`top_k` is served by selection instead of by sorting the vocabulary, and
  that is most models.** The sampler's head fast path could only satisfy top-k
  by widening until the head held `k` entries, and its loosening schedule
  multiplies a *negative* log-threshold by 4 — one step goes from `p_max/1024`
  to `p_max/e^27`, admitting most of the vocabulary and overflowing the
  4096-entry head cap. Instrumented on gemma-4-E4B: the first head carries 99%
  of the mass in 7 entries, fails `m >= 64`, and the next step overflows. It
  could not be fixed by relaxing the criterion either, because `pick_scaled`
  renormalises over exactly the `k` it is handed, so serving 7 where 64 were
  asked changes every probability.

  Now a quickselect partition takes the true top-k in O(n) and only those `k`
  are sorted. This is **exact, not approximate**: `cand_cmp` is a total order
  (logit descending, then id ascending, and ids are unique), so the k-largest
  set is unique and sorting it reproduces the first `k` of a full sort element
  for element. Verified bit-identical against the previous sampler across
  seeds on two real models and twelve seeds on the small fixture.

  Decode throughput, same seed, 96 tokens:

  | model | backend | before | after |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | gemma-4-E4B-it Q4_K_M | CUDA | 26.1 tok/s | **59.0** |
  | gemma-4-E4B-it Q4_K_M | CPU | 9.6 | **12.5** |
  | Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M | CUDA | 54.1 | **72.6** |
  | Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M | CPU | 15.2 | **16.4** |

  The win scales with vocabulary size and decode speed, because sampling is a
  fixed per-token cost: 2.3x on a 262k-vocabulary model that decodes fast, 8%
  on a slow CPU decode where the model dominates.

- **`--cpu-moe auto` crashed mid-forward on every sparse-MoE model, and the
  first diagnosis was wrong.** It was not a VRAM over-commit. `full` (is
  `output.weight` uploaded) needs the output tensor to fit the budget; `partial`
  (does the device compute logits) is the layer count alone. The auto fit places
  attention for every layer, then spends what survives on expert banks — so the
  last of the budget could go to a bank, dropping `output.weight` while `G` still
  equalled `n_layer`. The forward then asked the device for logits from a tensor
  that was never uploaded. `--cpu-moe 20` "worked" only because fewer banks left
  room by accident, and the plain split cannot reach the state at all. The fix
  reserves what a full split still owes before placing banks, plus an invariant
  guard that makes the split honestly partial when the reserve cannot be met.
  Not only a crash fix: gemma-4-26B-A4B decode goes 4.74 → **10.89 tok/s**.

- **Two UTF-8 defects in server output.** Ill-formed sequences are now rejected
  rather than only ill-shaped JSON, and multi-byte characters whose bytes span
  two tokens are held back while streaming instead of being emitted as
  replacement characters.

- **The unfiltered sampling path is served from a head instead of a full sort.**
  `top_p = 1.0` was the slowest path in the sampler, and two shipped presets use
  it.

- **`compare_llamacpp.py` was reporting prefill from a warm prefix cache.** The
  timing request now runs first with `cache_prompt: false`, and the figures
  agree with each engine's self-reported timings — which is the check that the
  method is sound. Top-logprob entries keyed by rendered string also excluded
  (and counted) the empty string, which is not a token identity: on Ministral-8B
  that manufactured a 4.59-nat divergence on a run whose greedy text was
  byte-identical. MoE rows are now like-for-like via `--runner-arg`.

- **gpt-oss and gemma-4-E4B certified at whole-graph offload.** The kernel box
  could only reach a 13/24 split for a 12.1 GB model on an 8 GB card and said so
  rather than implying whole-graph identity; re-run on the 25 GB slice, both are
  5/5 byte-identical with every layer and `output.weight` on device (24/24 and
  42/42). `cpu_cuda_check.py` now records the split it achieved, so a partial
  report can no longer read as a whole-graph one.

- **`--reserve`, `--reserve-vram`, `--reserve-ram` and `--reserve-cpu` are in
  `--help`.** They were implemented and documented in the README but absent from
  the binary's own option list.

- **CHANGELOG.md restored.** All 737 lines were deleted as collateral in
  `82e799b`, a commit about `--cpu-moe`; six commits carried it empty and
  `make release-check` was red for the whole stretch. Recovered from `45572e2`
  and the entries above reconstructed from the intervening commit messages.


- **gpt-oss runs on CUDA.** The load-time GPU refusal is gone; everything it
  guarded landed together, generated on the CUDA 13.3 box that owns
  `kernels_ptx.h`. *MXFP4 matvec kernels* (`k_mv_mxfp4`, `k_mv_mxfp4_b`,
  `k_moe_mv_mxfp4`): 17-byte block, E8M0 power-of-two scale decoded with
  `ldexpf` exactly as the CPU's `dq_mxfp4`, nibbles through the same signed
  codebook. *Sink-aware attention softmax*: the per-head sink logit joins the
  max scan and the denominator with no value row — transcribed from
  `softmax_sink()` — in `k_attn` and in `k_attn_merge`'s global reduction
  only, so the flash-decoding split partials (`k_attn_dec`,
  `k_attn_dec_seq`) needed no change and every other arch's arithmetic is
  untouched. *`ACT_SWIGLU_OAI` on device* (dense actmul + both MoE actmul
  kernels, one shared `swiglu_oai()` mirroring the CPU's clamp and early-zero
  guard). *Router + per-expert biases through both CUDA MoE paths*: the
  router bias rides the matvec tail (bitwise what the CPU's add-after
  computes); gate/up biases land before the activation; the down bias lands
  before the routing weight scales it — on the eager path by deferring the
  weight fold until after the down matvec, on the fused path as
  `selw*db` inside `k_moe_sum`. The kernel dispatch tables also grew past
  `T_MXFP4 = 39` (they were sized 32 and would have indexed out of bounds),
  and the grouped prefill declares itself ineligible for biased experts
  rather than dropping them. `make test` green; Qwen3-8B and the MoE
  tolerance fixture verified unchanged (CPU==GPU byte identity holds).

- **`parallel_tool_calls: true` is supported on buffered requests.** The
  envelope becomes a bounded `{"calls": [ ... ]}` array over the *same*
  discriminated union, so a direct answer is simply a one-element array
  holding the final branch — the model chooses how many entries to emit, not
  which document shape to use. Capped at 8 entries by construction, because an
  unbounded array under a token budget is a truncation waiting to happen and
  every legal document must stay completable by `sval_close`. Calls map back
  with distinct ascending ids through one shared per-entry mapper, so the
  single-call and multi-call paths cannot drift in how they render a call.
  **Streaming still refuses it**, with its own reason: the demultiplexer
  tracks one call per turn, and silently downgrading to a single call would
  leave the caller expecting calls it never gets. Where the strict envelope
  does not apply at all — no tools declared, or the ornith template's native
  protocol — the flag stays tolerated exactly as before, since ordinary
  OpenAI-shaped traffic sends it alongside requests that will never call
  anything. Gates: multi-call mapping driven directly in tests/test_tools.c
  (ids, separators, the mixed and wrong-shape documents) rather than through
  a sampled model, plus the rewritten conformance contract.

- **Gemma-4 E-series (E2B/E4B) runs, on CPU.** Both missing halves landed.
  *Per-layer embeddings*: a second embedding table gives each token one
  `n_embd_per_layer` slice per layer; those slices are mixed once per batch
  with a projection of the input embedding, and each layer then gates its
  post-FFN residual through them and adds the result back before the layer
  output scale. *Shared-KV layers*: every layer at or past
  `n_layer - shared_kv_layers` computes no K/V at all and attends over the
  cache of the last KV-owning layer **of its own sliding/full type**
  — `kv_from_start - 2` sliding, `kv_from_start - 1` full. Those layers
  reserve no cache rows (E4B's allocation drops by 18/42) and the prefix
  cache skips them so a snapshot cannot save the same rows twice. Their
  `attn_k`/`attn_v` tensors exist in the file and are deliberately never read.
  A mismatched-geometry alias is refused at load rather than reinterpreted.

  **The GPU is refused** for these models, with its own message: the device
  graph has no per-layer-embedding stage and its KV allocator sizes one
  independent region per layer, so aliasing would silently attend over zeros.

  Verified against llama.cpp b10076 on `gemma-4-E4B-it-Q4_K_M`. Greedy
  agreement is at the **quantisation noise floor, not token identity**, and
  the control run is what makes that claim meaningful: over 16 prompts × 32
  tokens the E-series scores 8/16 identical with a 0.29-nat worst-case
  logprob delta, while **Qwen2.5-7B — a long-verified dense architecture on
  the same harness — scores 6/16 with 0.24 nats.** The E-series profile is
  indistinguishable from a model already known correct; both engines flip on
  sub-0.3-nat argmax ties, and llama.cpp flips on them by itself depending on
  whether its prompt cache was warm. New `scripts/token_divergence.py` is the
  tool that measures this: it walks both engines greedily and reports the
  first differing position with the logprob gap between the two contenders on
  each side, which distinguishes a coin-flip tie from an arithmetic fault —
  something `reference_compare.py`'s exact-text gate cannot do.

- **gpt-oss: sliding-window layers were roped in the wrong regime.** Runner
  treats SWA layers as a separate rope world — right for gemma, whose locals
  rope at base 10k with no scaling while its globals run 1M + YaRN — so it
  built the local frequency table from the raw base *before* the YaRN scaling
  block and forced the YaRN magnitude factor to 1.0 there. llama.cpp's
  openai-moe graph passes the same `freq_base`, `freq_scale`, `ext_factor` and
  `attn_factor` to **every** layer and varies only the KV window. With a
  sliding-window pattern of period 2, half of gpt-oss's 24 layers were wrong.

  The base for those layers had already been fixed when the CPU path landed,
  which made the regime look handled; the frequency scaling and the magnitude
  factor live in two other places and were missed. Output stayed fluent
  throughout — the failure mode is a systematic bias, not garbage.

  Layer 0's relative divergence from the reference drops **7.31% → 0.70%**.
  Over 16 prompts × 16 greedy tokens, runner vs llama.cpp goes from 4/16 to
  **9/16** identical and the worst-case logprob delta from **0.589 to 0.151** —
  now *below* runner's own 0.272 sensitivity to a KV-precision change, i.e. at
  or under the model's own floor.

  `model_rope_mscale()` is now the single definition of the per-layer YaRN
  magnitude factor, shared by the CPU and both CUDA rope sites, because a
  disagreement between them is invisible in output that still reads fluently.
  The new `swa_rope_global` flag is set only for gpt-oss; gemma-4-E4B and
  gemma-4-26B-A4B are byte-identical across the change.

- **The gemma-4 E-series runs on CUDA.** The refusal is lifted; both mechanisms
  have a device path and it is byte-identical to the host. Per-layer
  embeddings: the pre-pass stays on the host (it reads a bf16 projection and a
  q5_K table that have no device kernels) and ships its result once per
  forward — 43 KB for a single E4B token — after which each layer gates,
  multiplies by its slice, projects, norms and adds entirely on device.
  Shared-KV layers project Q and skip K/V, attending over the owning layer's
  rows through the same aliased offsets the host path uses, so they cost no
  device cache either.

  **No new kernels**, which matters because the committed PTX is generated by a
  different machine's nvcc: the stage composes `k_mv_f32`, the existing
  `k_gelu_mul` (already exactly `gelu(a)*b`), `k_rmsnorm` and `k_add`.
  `src/kernels_ptx.h` is untouched.

  Gate is CPU/GPU identity, which for this family is exact even though
  cross-engine identity is not. Byte-identical on gemma-4-E4B-it-Q4_K_M over
  four prompts at 32 tokens and one at 128, at full 42/42 offload; and on the
  generated fixture at every partial-offload split, including the ones that put
  a shared-KV layer on a different device from the layer whose rows it reads.
  Throughput on the Blackwell MIG slice, 134-token prompt / 64 decode:
  prompt 76 → 301 tok/s, decode 13.7 → 63.7 tok/s.

  The layer-weight accounting now includes the per-layer embedding matrices —
  they are f32 in the published GGUFs and add ~5 MB per layer, so omitting them
  would under-budget the offload and overcommit VRAM.

- **The gemma-4 MoE identity claim is withdrawn, and replaced with a
  measurement.** Re-running the gate on the *certified* artifact
  (`ggml-org/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF`, sha `d208665a…`, now matching the pin in
  `tests/compatibility/models.json`) gives 4/5 on `reference_compare.py` at
  b10076, not the token identity the README claimed. No archived artifact ever
  backed that claim, and the dense gemma-4 claim in `model.c` cites b9964 — a
  different revision.

  The claim is withdrawn because it is **unachievable for this model, by any
  engine pair**, not because runner regressed. New
  `scripts/sensitivity_floor.py` measures what a model does to a small numeric
  change, and on the certified 26B runner disagrees with **itself** — same
  build, same weights, only the KV cache precision changed — on 11 of 16
  prompts, against the 9 it disagrees with llama.cpp on. A perturbation
  strictly inside one binary moves the output further than switching engines
  does, which leaves no room to attribute the gap to a fault. Direct checks
  agree: layer 0's `attn_norm` matches the reference exactly and the
  pre-softmax router logits match to ~0.1–0.5%. The amplifier is discrete
  top-8-of-128 routing over Q4_0 weights — at layer 2 the 6th and 7th selected
  experts sat 0.0002 apart in weight, so a rounding difference flips an expert
  and rewrites an eighth of the FFN output.

  For contrast, on the same harness gemma-4-E4B is perfectly self-consistent
  under that perturbation (16/16) and matches llama.cpp on 11/16 — essentially
  llama.cpp's own cold-vs-warm-cache floor of 12/16. Evidence:
  `tests/compatibility/out/divergence-study-gemma4-moe-2026-08-01.json`.

- **`RUNNER_DEBUG_ACT` traces are now diffable against llama.cpp.** Each line
  carries the sum plus the leading and trailing three values in
  `llama-eval-callback`'s layout, and gemma-4 MoE layers additionally dump the
  pre-softmax router logits and the selected expert ids with their weights.
  That is what localises a divergence to a layer: comparing aggregate stats
  against another engine's per-row values cannot.

- **Completion logprobs now carry token ids** (`token_ids` and
  `top_token_ids`, alongside the existing decoded strings). Two distinct ids
  can decode to the same text, and control tokens render differently across
  runtimes — runner writes `<eos>` where llama.cpp writes `""` — so a
  cross-engine comparison keyed on the rendered string reports identical
  tokens as divergences. It did, until this. The two duplicated emitters
  behind the streaming and buffered paths were also collapsed onto one.

- **Gemma-4 E-series: array-form sliding-window patterns are read correctly,
  and the refusal now names what is missing.**
  `attention.sliding_window_pattern` is published two ways — dense gemma3/4
  give an integer period, the E-series gives a per-layer BOOLEAN ARRAY. Read
  as a u32 an array key silently yields the default, mis-marking every layer,
  so both forms are now handled with the array winning when present (dense
  models are unaffected: verified byte-identical CPU-vs-GPU output on
  gemma-4-26B before and after). The E-series load refusal changed from
  naming the family to naming the two missing mechanisms — per-layer
  embeddings and shared-KV layers — because those are what a reader needs.
  (Both halves have since been implemented — see the entry above.)

- **Measured: partial expert offload helps prefill and hurts decode, and
  plain layer offload beats both.** Qwen3-Coder-30B on the Blackwell MIG with
  the budget capped to a 12 GB card (`--reserve-vram 48`, `-c 4096`,
  512-token prompt / 64-token decode, median of 3):

  | config | experts on GPU | prompt tok/s | decode tok/s |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `--cpu-moe` (all host) | 0/48 | 15.5 | 5.35 |
  | `--cpu-moe auto` | 29/48 | **28.5** (+84%) | 4.32 (**-19%**) |
  | `--gpu-layers 24` | — | **43.9** (+184%) | **8.27** (+55%) |

  A control at the full 25 GB budget shows the new binding path is free:
  `--cpu-moe 0` (every expert on the GPU through bindings) measures
  194.1 / 101.5 against the ordinary full-offload upload's 194.0 / 100.5. So
  `auto`'s decode cost is inherent to *mixed* placement — the interleaved
  per-layer host bounces — not to the implementation. Two consequences worth
  stating plainly: the first outside install's conclusion that layer offload
  beat `--cpu-moe` is confirmed and much larger than its own numbers showed;
  and `--reserve-vram` **without an explicit `-c`** grows the KV cache to fill
  the reservation, which starves expert placement (auto placed 0/48 banks
  until the context was pinned). No defaults changed — the advisor's
  moe-hybrid preference is an owner call, now with numbers under it.

- **gpt-oss (OpenAI MoE) runs on the CPU path.** `gpt-oss` joins the
  architecture allowlist with the four pieces it actually needs, each
  transcribed from llama.cpp rather than inferred: per-head **attention
  sinks** (a learned logit joining only the softmax max and denominator, with
  no value row — `softmax_sink()`), the clamped alpha-sigmoid
  **`ACT_SWIGLU_OAI`** activation (alpha 1.702, limit 7; plain SwiGLU here is
  silently-wrong output), the **router bias plus per-expert gate/up/down
  biases** in both CPU MoE paths, and `post_attention_norm` as the FFN input
  norm (the qwen35 shape). Its sliding-window layout needed no new logic —
  the existing `((i + 1) % period)` form with period 2 is identical to
  llama.cpp's `set_swa_pattern(2)` — but its SWA layers inherit the GLOBAL
  rope base (150k), where the runner's generic default would have used 10k.
  A vendor sampling preset is included (temperature 1.0 / top_p 1.0, no
  repetition penalty, per the model card).
  **The GPU refuses this architecture at load**, with a stated reason: a
  sink-aware attention softmax and MXFP4 kernels do not exist on that
  backend, and running there would silently drop the sinks.
  **Not certified, deliberately.** Greedy agreement with pinned llama.cpp
  b10076 over the five standard prompts is **4/5 exact at 8 tokens** and 1/5
  at 32 (evidence: `tests/compatibility/out/reference-gpt-oss-2026-07-31-*`).
  The residual is diagnosed, not mysterious: ggml gives MXFP4 a
  `vec_dot_type` of `Q8_0`, i.e. llama.cpp quantizes the *activation* vector
  to int8 before each expert dot, while the runner dots against full fp32
  activations. The two are different computations by construction, so the
  paths drift apart at near-ties — every divergence is mid-sentence with both
  continuations plausible, after 10–88 characters of exact agreement. For
  scale, the same 8-token method scored the *certified* archs at llama3 3/5,
  qwen3 4/5 and gemma4 0/5 on 2026-07-30. The README certified table is
  untouched: the full certification method includes CPU-vs-GPU identity,
  which an arch the GPU refuses cannot have.

- **Fused-vs-eager MoE routing tolerance gate (`make test`).** Certification
  defines MoE byte identity over the eager host-routing path
  (`RUNNER_MOE_EAGER=1`); the shipping fused default's weaker contract —
  selection identical, routing weights within ~2 ulp — had only ever been spot
  checked by hand at the first routing. `tests/test_moe_tol.c` now gates it in
  the shape of test-kv-tol/test-tc-tol: teacher-forced top-1 agreement with the
  near-tie escape (a decisive-margin flip means selection diverged, not just its
  weights) plus a mean|dlogit| bound. New `gpu_moe_eager_force()` test hook lets
  one process run both paths. The gate needs a fixture whose router is not zero —
  the dense-oracle MoE fixtures are 0.5/0.5 either way and can only compare a
  path with itself — so `make-test-moe.py` gained `moe4` (real router, four
  distinct experts, top-2), deliberately not dense-equivalent. Measured row on
  that fixture: mean|dlogit| 1.47e-08 = 2.0e-08 of range, 0/32 flips. Real
  quantized-model rows want a free full-offload slice; the gate self-skips
  (never passes) without one.
- **MTP heads are admitted as training-only, for every architecture.** An
  export whose `block_count` includes auxiliary NextN/MTP predictor blocks
  declares them with `<arch>.nextn_predict_layers`; those blocks are now
  excluded from the backbone on any architecture (this generalizes the
  qwen35-only handling — qwen35 exports read the same key and are unchanged),
  so dense decoding is bit-for-bit identical to an export without them. The
  load line and `/v1/capabilities` report `mtp.declared_layers` with
  `consumed: false`, so a controller sees the exclusion instead of inferring
  it from a layer count. A profile whose `required_features` contains `mtp`
  is refused with its own reason — requiring consumption asks for a verifier
  this build does not implement, which is not the same as an unknown feature
  name. Consumption itself remains unbuilt by design (the staged contract:
  admission first, verifier second). Gate: tests/test_mtp_admission.py.
- **`--bench-json` benchmarks a realistic prefill and reports both phases in
  seconds.** The default prompt was one ten-token sentence, so the instrument
  reported healthy numbers on the first outside install while a realistic
  2,100-token prompt took 89 s to reach its first word — prefill, not decode,
  was the wall. The default is now a synthesized ~512-token prompt (clamped to
  the context and to whatever `-n` needs), `-p`/`-f` still override it, and the
  JSON gained `prompt_s` / `gen_s` beside the existing rates so time-to-first-
  token is directly readable. Numbers from earlier `--bench-json` runs are not
  comparable to these, which is the point.
- **The `--cpu-moe` x `--gpu-layers` worst-of-both is no longer silent.**
  Capping the attention split under tensor-role placement moves attention to
  the CPU while freeing almost nothing (the expert banks are what fill VRAM):
  measured 10.3 tok/s against 12.7 all-host and 14.6 layer-split-alone on a
  12 GB card. The pair stays legal — it is meaningful once a partial expert
  count is what the headroom is reserved for — but a run that caps below what
  already fits now says so and points at `--cpu-moe N|auto`. A bare
  `--cpu-moe` that leaves room for expert banks also reports how many
  `--cpu-moe auto` would place, counted by the same greedy rule so the advice
  cannot over-promise.
- **Partial expert offload — `--cpu-moe [N|auto]`.** Expert placement is now
  per-layer instead of all-or-nothing: `auto` fills whatever VRAM the
  attention split leaves with whole expert banks (shallowest first) and hosts
  only the remainder, `N` pins exactly the deepest N expert layers to the
  host, and a bare `--cpu-moe` keeps its original all-on-host meaning. Device
  banks upload as ordinary offset-resolved bindings, so a device-resident and
  a host-resident bank coexist inside one forward. The split line now reports
  `experts N/M layers on GPU, K on host` — the first outside install could not
  see that all-or-nothing was leaving 8.8 GB of a 12 GB card idle, because
  nothing reported it. `--caps` advertises `cpu_moe_partial`. Measured on the
  Blackwell MIG (slice mostly occupied by another process, so only 3 of 48
  banks fit): Qwen3-Coder-30B prompt 15.82 -> 16.96 tok/s, decode 5.49 -> 5.85
  (+7% each for 6% of the banks moved). Gates: dense-oracle identity for all
  three expert layouts x {0, 1, auto} with the silent-fallback guard, strict
  count parsing, and real-model CPU==GPU byte identity on Qwen3-Coder-30B
  under the eager pin.

- **Grammar fast-forward (JC-R2, runner half) — opt-in.** Under an active
  constraint, when the validator pins a unique byte continuation (probed by
  trial on validator copies — the same validator-by-trial design as the
  sampler filter), the pinned run's tokenization is drafted for free and
  verified by the target through the existing speculative walk, so output is
  byte-identical to plain decoding with or without a `--draft` model in the
  loop (`make test` gate: tests/test_grammar_ff.c, identity + engagement +
  exclusions, ASan-clean). `RUNNER_SPEC_STATS=1` now reports grammar
  acceptance per generation (`grammar a/d`) — the constrained-segment
  acceptance measurement the judgment co-processor plan calls for.
  **Default OFF** (`RUNNER_GRAMMAR_FF=1` to enable, value parsed strictly):
  measured on EuroLLM-9B and Mistral-Nemo (CPU, contract schema), today's
  raw-encode drafter is 4-12% slower at 33-38% acceptance — real subword
  vocabs tokenize pinned runs differently than the model samples them. The
  toy byte-level vocab accepts 100%; the structural fix is a
  model-canonical (Syntetik) drafter, which is the remaining JC-R2 half.
- **Speculative verify batch bound fix.** `model_forward_batch_keep` bounded
  its batch by `spec_batch` only; with `-b` smaller than the draft window
  (n_batch < 16) the verify batch overwrote the activation buffers past
  their allocation (heap corruption in the `--draft` path, found by ASan
  under the new grammar-ff test). Both the primitive and the draft-window
  clamps now respect `n_batch`.
- New `tok_encode_raw`: raw-byte encode without BOS/specials/segment
  normalization (SPM's leading-space prefix), so a token list can
  round-trip to exactly the input bytes wherever the vocab allows.
- **`choice_logprobs` — constrained-choice posteriors (JC-R1).** Constrained
  requests (JSON mode / `json_schema` / tool schemas) can set
  `"choice_logprobs": true` to get, per decision point (a step where ≥ 2 of
  the probed top-`M` candidates were grammar-legal; `choice_logprobs_probe`
  8–64, default 32), the legal alternatives with a posterior renormalized
  over the legal probed set, raw full-vocab logprobs, and probed coverage.
  Captured from raw logits before the repeat penalty, payload phase only
  (thinking preludes have no decision points), legality decided by the same
  validator trial the sampler uses. Buffered responses only; rejected with
  spec-decode. New `scripts/cl-calibration.py` turns labeled decision
  records into accuracy/Brier/ECE + a reliability table and can gate via
  `--max-ece`. Conformance: `tests/conformance/test_choice_logprobs.py`.
- Published benchmark MoE rows updated after the device-routing work:
  Qwen3-30B-A3B decode 102.2 tok/s (67% of llama.cpp, was 48% at
  v0.1.4) and prefill 194.0 (6.0%, was 3.3%) on the Blackwell MIG;
  gemma-4-26B 24.7 / 23.6. docs/benchmarks.md and the shareable page
  carry the same rows.
- `runner` now depends on `src/kernels_ptx.h` in the Makefile: a pull
  that changed only the regenerated PTX header rebuilt nothing, and a
  publication run measured yesterday's kernels for half an hour before
  the stale binary was caught. Same class as the certification footguns
  this week — the build must never silently serve old code.

- MoE routing normalizations reverted to per-element division — the
  k_moe_route PTX section is byte-identical to the 4719de6 body again
  (verified by section hash), which is exactly what the Blackwell
  splice-proof restored to 102.9 tok/s decode (the reciprocal-multiply
  mirror's rcp.rn.f32 codegen JITed ~58 µs/launch slower on that MIG,
  ×48 layers = 23% of MoE decode; the mirror's bit-identity purpose was
  already retired by the eager certification pin). Fused-path selw bound
  restated in the compat doc: within ~2 ulp of the host reference (two
  independent 1-ulp sources), observed 1 ulp at the first routing on
  both cert boxes. Gates on the 3070: make test green; eager-pinned
  CPU==GPU identity byte-green on both MoE models; bench md5 unchanged.

- MoE routing exp reverted to fp32 device expf (keeping the
  reciprocal-multiply mirror), now that certification pins the eager
  path (`RUNNER_MOE_EAGER=1` in the harnesses since bf93510): the
  correctly-rounded double-exp's only purpose was bit-matching
  correctly-rounded hosts, a property void on the fast-math cert box.
  NOTE the property downgrade this trades away: the fused default is no
  longer byte-identical to the host routing even on correctly-rounded
  (UCRT-class) hosts — its contract is now the verified weaker class,
  expert selection identical + selw within 1 ulp of the host reference
  (re-verified on the 3070 with RUNNER_DEBUG_MOE after the revert;
  docs/compatibility-program.md updated to match). Gates on the 3070:
  make test green; certified (eager-pinned) CPU==GPU identity green on
  both MoE models over 128 greedy tokens; bench md5 unchanged.

- Fixed the full-offload CPU==GPU byte-identity regression the Blackwell
  box found in the P1 MoE path (near-tie flip at ~token 60 on
  Qwen3-30B). Isolated with a new routing-bits discriminator: expert
  SELECTION was identical, but selw differed in the last mantissa bit
  from two compounding 1-ulp sources in k_moe_route — device expf vs the
  host libm, and exact IEEE division vs the -freciprocal-math
  reciprocal-multiply the -ffast-math host build actually emits. The
  kernel now computes the softmax exponential as
  (float)exp((double)x) — the correctly-rounded float exp, which
  bit-matches a correctly-rounded host expf (verified against UCRT on
  20M sampled inputs; residual double-rounding probability ~2^-28 per
  call) — and mirrors the reciprocal-multiply normalization. Verified on
  the 3070: fused output byte-identical to the eager (v0.1.4-certified)
  path over 128 greedy tokens on BOTH MoE models at ngl 17 and 19, and
  CPU==GPU identical; layer-1 routing bits equal, which transitively
  certifies every P1 kernel in layer 0's pipeline. Caveat for the
  full-offload re-cert: if the Blackwell CPU build auto-vectorizes the
  host softmax through libmvec's ~4-ulp expf, its CPU routing bits are
  unmatchable from device code — the new RUNNER_DEBUG_MOE dump (hex
  sel/selw from both paths) + RUNNER_MOE_EAGER (force the v0.1.4
  host-routing path) discriminate that case in two runs.
- (Q4_0, gemma4-moe) tc-tol failure investigated: the tail-safe K loop
  is NOT the cause — a synthetic n_ff=704 Q4_0 model (the exact
  X.5x128-step class gemma exercises) passes at 0.00004 of range with
  0/64 flips, and a 10x-weight variant scales the deviation smoothly
  (0.00022, still 0 flips), pointing at gemma-4's activation magnitudes
  under fp16 tile staging rather than a kernel defect. The gate is doing
  its job; the row stays unpromoted. If that row should ever pass:
  per-column activation absmax scaling in the TC tile is the identified
  follow-up.

- Tensor-core GEMM twins for Q8_0 and Q4_0 (moe-gpu-routing spec P3),
  same MMQ-style structure as the Q4_K TC kernel — block-cooperative
  fp16 weight-tile dequant with per-element values matching the scalar
  kernels exactly, fp32-accumulated m16n16k16 MMAs — plus a tail-safe K
  loop (gemma-4-MoE's n_ff_exp=704 is not a 128-multiple; elements past
  n_in stage as zeros). Both OPT-IN behind RUNNER_CUDA_TC and the
  per-(type, arch) test-tc-tol gate; tc_promoted() is unchanged, so no
  default path moved. test-tc-tol now recognizes all TC-capable types
  (was: hard-skip without Q4_K). Fresh gate rows measured on the 3070
  (full offload, 64 teacher-forced positions, 0 top-1 flips each):
  (Q8_0, qwen3) 0.00005 of range, (Q8_0, phi3) 0.00002, (Q4_0, qwen3
  requantized) 0.00003 — all far under the 0.005 bound. Promotion
  remains the owner's decision with the Blackwell rows.

- MoE GPU prefill: expert-grouped GEMM (moe-gpu-routing spec P2) — the
  CUDA port of the CPU `cabdad1` grouping. A prefill tile is routed on
  device, its routing read back once (prefill is never graph-captured),
  and each active expert then runs ONCE over all its routed tokens with
  the batched k_gemm/k_mv_b kernels — expert weights stream through the
  SMs once per tile instead of once per (token, slot); the per-token
  sync+DtoH per MoE layer collapses to one per layer per tile.
  Accumulation mirrors the CPU grouped path (ascending expert index,
  routing weight at the scatter). gemma-4's dense shared branch now also
  batches across the tile instead of looping per token.
  Follow-up measured on the 3070: the fixed-width GEMM kernels compute
  all 16 tile columns whatever the batch, and a 16-token tile routes only
  ~1-2 tokens per expert, so naive grouping LOST GPU time (gemma Q4_0
  prefill −19%). Expert matmuls now pick the narrowest kernel that
  covers the token count (batch-1 GEMV at 1, the width-classed f_gemvb
  twins to 8, the full GEMM beyond — TC whenever promoted/forced), and
  grouping engages only for expert types with width-classed kernels
  (Q8_0/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K); gemma-4 Q4_0 keeps the per-token fused prefill
  until a batched Q4_0 kernel exists. 3070 result: gemma regression
  erased (14.8 tok/s prefill, above the fused path), qwen at end-to-end
  parity with GPU-busy still 1.65× the fused path's — the grouped win at
  this tile size has to come from TC on the expert GEMMs; the Blackwell
  box should A/B fused-vs-grouped prefill when re-measuring.
  Certified: CPU==GPU
  greedy byte-identical (short 128-tok and 510-tok-prefill configs on
  Qwen3-30B; short config on gemma-4-26B), pinned-b10076 text unchanged,
  bench md5s unchanged, make test green. Noted: gemma-4-26B long-prefill
  CPU-vs-GPU greedy divergence on a pathological repetitive prompt
  pre-exists in v0.1.4-alpha (P2's GPU output is byte-identical to the
  eager path's there — no regression; tracked in the suite plan).

- MoE GPU decode: device-side routing + fused indirect expert matvecs
  (moe-gpu-routing spec P1). Softmax → top-k → renormalize now runs in a
  serial-per-token device kernel that mirrors the host reference bit for
  bit (same scan/summation order, ties to lowest index), and one indirect
  launch per projection covers all top-k experts, reading `sel[]` on
  device — the per-token `cuStreamSynchronize` + DtoH round-trips are
  gone (~48/token on Qwen3-30B) and launches per decoded token fall
  ~4× on the MoE fixture (52.0 → 1.3 with the graph, see below). With no
  host-dependent branching left, fused-layout MoE no longer forces
  `graph_bad`: full-offload MoE decode is CUDA-graph captured. The
  legacy split-expert layout and expert quant types without an indirect
  kernel (outside F32/F16/Q8_0/Q4_0/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K) keep the eager path
  unchanged. gemma-4's dual-branch routed experts use the same device
  routing (per-expert down scales uploaded per layer). Certified on this
  box (RTX 3070, partial offload): CPU==GPU greedy byte-identical over
  128 tokens on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M and gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Q4_0;
  Qwen3-30B greedy text unchanged vs the pinned b10076 comparison;
  `make test` + `test-moe` green; bench.sh md5s unchanged.

## v0.1.4-alpha — 2026-07-29

### Headline: tensor-core prefill by default, published benchmarks, and the European roster

The tensor-core prefill GEMM is now the **default** on seven
tolerance-gated dense (Q4_K, arch) combos (+47–77% prefill, decode
unchanged), backed by a new teacher-forced tolerance gate
(`make test-tc-tol`); the decode GEMV bandwidth pass lifts dense decode to
73–79% of llama.cpp on the reference box, and the first head-to-head
benchmark is published (`docs/benchmarks.md`) with the losing rows
included. Six European models join the SHA-pinned compatibility manifest
under the new Europe & US model-scope policy (`docs/model-scope.md`) —
whose evidence runs found and fixed three real defects (a silent MoE
GPU→CPU fallback, a fast-math expf-overflow UB in CPU silu, and two
option footguns) and reported a GGUF conversion bug upstream to
OpenLLM-France. Full detail below.

- Fixed CPU decode corruption on models with extreme FFN gate values
  (found by TildeOpen-30b's certification run): silu computes expf(-g),
  fp32 expf overflows past ~88, and the -ffast-math build treats that
  overflow as UB — the auto-vectorized libmvec expf returned garbage for
  TildeOpen's last-layer gates (|g| up to ~2.7e3), degrading every
  pure-CPU decode step into <unk> emissions while GPU (CUDA expf
  saturates properly) was unaffected. gated_act now short-circuits silu
  to 0 below g = -80, where |silu| < 1.5e-33, so expf never sees an
  overflowing argument. Verified: TildeOpen CPU==GPU byte-identical over
  128 greedy tokens, greedy_reference 4/5 vs pinned b10076 (was 1/5),
  and lucie/eurollm CPU outputs bit-identical pre/post fix (the guard is
  a no-op for in-range models). RUNNER_DEBUG_ACT=N now dumps the N-th
  forward pass (was: first only) — the instrument this debug needed.
- `--gpu-layers 0` now means what it says — no GPU (same as `--gpu off`).
  It used to be the auto-fit sentinel and silently ran FULL GPU, a
  documented footgun that bit its own certification run: the roster's
  first cpu_cuda evidence used it as the CPU side and compared GPU with
  GPU. Re-verified with a true `--gpu off` CPU side: all five EU models
  and Qwen3-30B-A3B are byte-identical CPU vs GPU over 128 greedy tokens.
  Omit the flag for auto-fit.
- TildeOpen-30b added to the compatibility manifest (SHA-pinned): loads
  and generates coherently on GPU (llama arch, 60 layers, full 19.4 GB
  offload) — and its evidence run exposed an OPEN ENGINE DEFECT: the
  pure-CPU path emits <unk> for content tokens from the second generated
  token onward (batched CPU prefill is sane per the activation dump; the
  failure is single-token CPU decode, deterministic, independent of -b/-t).
  TildeOpen is the first model to trip it; its unique geometry — GQA 48:8
  (ratio 6), vocab 131072, n_embd 6144 — is the suspect surface. cpu_cuda
  and greedy_reference are recorded FAILED for TildeOpen until the defect
  is fixed; GPU serving is unaffected.
- Certified the European roster into the compatibility program: EuroLLM-9B,
  Lucie-7B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, Teuken-7B and salamandra-7b are SHA-pinned in
  `tests/compatibility/models.json` with a recorded evidence run — all five
  pass load, cpu_cuda (128-token greedy byte-identical, scalar path), chat
  and tool, plus the 8-token greedy_reference sweep against pinned llama.cpp
  b10076 (salamandra 5/5 exact; the others show the same divergence class as
  the long-certified models). Honest gaps recorded rather than skipped:
  Lucie's tokenizer FAILS the 721-string differential (259 divergences) —
  root-caused to the GGUF, not the engine: the conversion exports Lucie's
  BPE tokenizer as SentencePiece with all 65,024 merge ranks flattened to
  -1000, so the reference tokenization is unreproducible from the file by
  any engine (Runner and llama.cpp b10076 are token-identical on it, and
  the vendor's own official GGUF shares the defect — an upstream
  conversion bug affecting every GGUF consumer of Lucie);
  EuroLLM's reference repo is gated and Teuken's has no tokenizer.json, so
  their tokenizer checks are not_executed; long_context was not run for the
  roster. `reference_compare.py` fixed en route: Runner rejects unknown
  model names now, so the harness asks each server for its served model id.
- Vendor sampling presets for four European families (each cites its
  source): `mistral-nemo` — Mistral's card is explicit that Nemo "requires
  smaller temperatures. We recommend to use a temperature of 0.3", so the
  0.7 `mistral` preset was actively wrong for it; `lucie` (temp 0.6 /
  top_p 0.9, generation_config.json) and `salamandra` (temp 0.6 /
  repetition_penalty 1.2, generation_config.json); `teuken` (temp 0.7 /
  top_p 0.95, model card usage example — the weakest citation grade, and
  marked as such). EuroLLM and TildeOpen publish nothing verifiable and
  deliberately stay on `generic`. Name matching requires BOTH "mistral"
  and "nemo" so NVIDIA's Nemotron cannot land on Mistral's temperature.
- Preset matching now runs over `general.name` PLUS the load path's
  basename (`sampler_ident`): quantizer metadata is unreliable — a real
  community salamandra GGUF ships `general.name` "snapshots" (the
  converter's HF cache directory) — and the filename still carries the
  family. All three resolution sites use the combined identity.
- **Promoted the tensor-core prefill GEMM to the default for gated dense
  (Q4_K, arch) combos** (owner decision on the tolerance-gate numbers):
  `llama`, `phi3`, `gemma4`, `qwen3`, `mistral`, `gemma3`, `smollm` — every
  row measured by `test_tc_tol` on real weights with 0/64 teacher-forced
  top-1 flips and ≤0.012% mean logit deviation. Measured effect on the
  Blackwell MIG: dense Q4_K prefill +47–77% with decode unchanged
  (llama-3.2-3b 263→438 tok/s, qwen3-4b 212→352). `qwen3moe` passed its
  gate too (0.216%, one near-tie) but stays opt-in: MoE routing amplifies
  fp16 noise ~86× over dense, and this promotion covers the dense family.
  Unmeasured archs (`qwen2`, `qwen35`, `stablelm`) remain scalar.
  `RUNNER_CUDA_TC=1` still forces the path on everywhere (how a gate
  candidate is measured), `=0`/`off` forces it off; unset now means "per
  the promotion table" instead of "off". `test_kv_tol` pins the GEMM path
  scalar (`gpu_tc_force(0)`) so its strict f16 CPU==GPU invariant keeps
  measuring the KV cache format, not the GEMM. NOTE for certification:
  on promoted combos, byte-identical CPU==GPU comparisons now compare TC
  against scalar — certify the scalar path with `RUNNER_CUDA_TC=0` or use
  the tolerance form (`test_tc_tol`); free-running greedy output was
  byte-identical TC-vs-scalar on all four models checked (512+128), but
  near-tie flips are possible in principle on other prompts.
- Added the TC tolerance gate (`tests/test_tc_tol.c`, `make test-tc-tol`),
  the promotion instrument the tensor-core plan required: teacher-forced
  logits over 64 positions, gated on top-1 agreement (near-tie escape as in
  the q8-KV gate) and a bounded mean logit deviation (≤0.5% of the mean
  logit range, computed over real logits — suppression sentinels excluded).
  Skips rather than passes when the TC kernel cannot engage (no GPU, no
  Q4_K tensor, or bit-identical logits meaning the kernel never launched).
  First measurements on the Blackwell MIG: llama 0.003%, phi3 0.004%,
  gemma4 0.012% of range with 0/64 flips; qwen3moe 0.216% with 1/64 — a
  near-tie at 0.001 of range. All four pass; the qwen3moe free-running
  divergence is thereby classified as near-tie amplification (the q8-KV
  class), not decisive error. Adds `gpu_tc_force()` so one process can
  compare both paths; `RUNNER_CUDA_TC` env behavior is unchanged.
- Fixed a silent MoE GPU→CPU fallback introduced by the `--cpu-moe` binding
  layer (active even without the flag): `binding_find` bounds-checks
  `t->nbytes` on every dispatch, but the per-expert slice descriptors built
  by `moe_expert_weight` and the gemma-4 fused `gate_up` slice kept the full
  multi-expert tensor size, so expert `e >= 1` failed the check, `enc_mv`
  returned false, and the whole forward silently ran on the CPU while the
  load banner still reported a full GPU split. Clamping the slice `nbytes`
  restores the GPU path. Measured on the Blackwell MIG 1g.24gb:
  Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M decode 4.5 → 76.3 tok/s (above the 56.5 pre-regression
  rate — expert matvecs now also use the new decode GEMVs);
  gemma-4-26B-A4B-Q4_0 6.9 → 23.5 tok/s (restored). Greedy output verified
  token-identical between CPU and GPU on both models. Note the CPU/GPU
  identity gates could not catch this class of defect: the fallback *is* the
  CPU path, so outputs matched while decode ran up to 12× slow.
- CUDA decode matvec pass (the suite plan's P1 decode lever): the Q4_K and
  Q5_K decode GEMVs now use aligned 8-byte quant loads, `float4` activation
  loads and a factored per-group affine; Q8_0 covers four blocks per warp
  iteration; Q6_K unrolls two blocks for load-level parallelism. Measured on
  an RTX 3070: Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M decode 31.7 → 53.3 tok/s (+68%),
  Llama-3.1-8B-Q5_K_M 31.0 → 54.0 tok/s (+74%), Qwen3-4B-Q8_0 58.4 → 60.5
  tok/s. GPU output remains token-identical to the CPU path on all verified
  models.
- Prefill matvec tiles widened from 8 to 16 tokens (MVB 16), halving the
  per-tile weight passes. The Q8_0 prefill GEMM keeps its proven 8-column
  tile and runs wide tiles as two launches. Known cost on the 3070:
  Qwen3-4B-Q8_0 prefill ~-4% (113.5 → 108.7 tok/s) from extra attention-score
  L2 pressure at 16 columns; Q4_K prefill is unchanged on the default path.
- Rebuilt the opt-in tensor-core prefill GEMM (`RUNNER_CUDA_TC=1`) as an
  MMQ-style kernel: the block dequantizes a 64-row × 128-K fp16 weight tile
  to shared memory once — 8-byte quant loads, two threads per row — and four
  warps' m16n16k16 MMAs reuse it against a 16-token fp16 activation tile with
  fp32 register accumulation. The previous per-warp variant measured 6-7×
  slower than the scalar GEMM; this one measures Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M prefill
  96.4 → 138.2 tok/s (+43%) on the RTX 3070, and its greedy output matched
  the CPU path token-for-token on the verification prompts. It remains
  opt-in behind the tolerance-gate promotion decision.
- Added sparse MoE tensor-role placement with `--cpu-moe`. CUDA retains
  attention/dense tensors and KV while expert FFNs execute from system RAM;
  packed uploads omit the expert bank instead of reserving GGUF-sized holes.
- `--caps` now advertises `tensor_placement.cpu_moe` for schedulers.
- Current Qwen3.5 GGUFs that include declared NextN/MTP blocks in
  `block_count` now load only the autoregressive backbone.
- Added native Qwen3.5/Ornith CUDA execution for recurrent Gated DeltaNet and
  full-attention blocks, including causal convolution/state kernels, gated
  attention, partial offload, pre-forward state snapshots for correct runtime
  CPU fallback, and compatibility with both `ssm_dt` tensor spellings.

## v0.1.3-alpha — 2026-07-24

### Headline: sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) support

The runner now runs real sparse **mixture-of-experts** models — the class the
field is converging on for modest-VRAM hardware — on CPU, fully on the GPU, and
with **partial CPU offload for cards smaller than the model**.

- **Architectures:** Mixtral-style `llama`-with-experts and `qwen3moe`
  (Qwen3-MoE). Both the modern fused 3D expert tensors and the legacy
  split-per-expert layout (older Mixtral GGUFs) are supported by one accessor —
  no forward-path branch on layout.
- **Qwen3-30B-A3B (Q4_K_M, 128 experts, top-8)** loads in **18.6 GB**, fits a
  **24 GB MIG slice on an NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell** with ~6 GB free, and
  decodes at **~55 tok/s on that hardware**. This is not presented as a
  representative result for every 24 GB consumer GPU. Greedy GPU output is
  **token-identical to Runner's CPU path on the same quantized GGUF**.
- **Partial CPU offload (8–16 GB cards):** the runner fits as many leading
  layers on the GPU as the VRAM budget allows and runs the rest on the CPU.
  Every configuration tested is token-identical to Runner's CPU path on the
  same quantized GGUF, or to the full-GPU quantized run where the model fits.
- **Q3_K GPU kernel (new):** Q3_K MoE now runs on the GPU. **Mixtral-8x7B
  Q3_K_M (20.4 GB) is fully GPU-resident on the Blackwell 24 GB MIG slice**,
  with GPU output token-identical to CPU.
- **Prefill throughput:** MoE prefill groups tokens by shared expert (batched
  per-expert matmul instead of one token at a time), ~5.6× the per-token CPU
  prefill rate. Decode is unchanged and bit-identical.
- **MXFP4 read support (gpt-oss format):** the OCP microscaling FP4 quant type
  (E8M0 × E2M1) is read and dequantized; validated against the real
  `gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4.gguf` (all 72 expert tensors read; a real row dequantizes
  to spec). *(gpt-oss as a whole needs architecture support to actually run;
  the MXFP4 tensors read correctly today.)*
- **Runnable == validated:** the loader refuses at load — rather than
  miscompute — shared-expert MoE (Qwen2-MoE / DeepSeek) and non-gemma GELU
  sparse MoE until each is validated on its own. Gemma-4's GELU dual-branch MoE
  is implemented and validated separately.

Correctness is checked with synthetic MoE configurations constructed to equal a
dense FFN (asserted token-identical in CI) and CPU/GPU agreement on real
quantized models. CPU/GPU agreement is an internal consistency check; independent
Runner-vs-llama.cpp comparison is handled by
`scripts/compare_llamacpp.py` when the same GGUF, hardware, and llama.cpp build
are available. See [`docs/moe-support.md`](docs/moe-support.md).

### Reliability & security hardening (July 2026 code review, RNR-###)

The release gate from the July code review is cleared, with the remaining
hardware-only Metal validation documented separately:

- Metal runtime fallback preserves the backend resource owner after
  `gpu_disable()`, so CPU fallback can keep using unified-memory KV buffers and
  `model_free()` never frees `MTLBuffer.contents` (RNR-001).
- Quantizer honors `general.alignment` and writes atomically (RNR-002/015).
- Load/scheduler lifecycle, an OOM tranche, and VRAM rollback; the
  OOM-as-truncated-prompt semantic bug is fixed (RNR-003/005/006/013).
- Architecture admission allowlist; unknown archs are experimental behind
  `RUNNER_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_ARCH=1` (RNR-004).
- GGUF typed getters validate type/sign/range/finiteness (RNR-010); one strict
  numeric parser for CLI + env (RNR-021); bounded CLI file reads (RNR-011).
- `load_cancel` is a C atomic (RNR-008); startup lease compares process
  start-time, not just PID (RNR-017); a drift gate guards the committed
  generated GPU headers (RNR-020).
- Python client: streamed `tool_calls` assembly + preserved `finish_reason`
  (RNR-016).
- `make test-moe` runs the synthetic MoE correctness suite in Linux/macOS CI;
  release packaging now checks tag, binary and Python versions, current release
  docs, changelog, and the generated `BUILD-INFO.txt` tag/commit before creating
  archives.
- CUDA compatibility is documented as NVIDIA Turing / compute capability 7.5 or
  newer, matching the embedded `sm_75` PTX target; older NVIDIA GPUs fall back
  to CPU.
- Windows `make test` now builds the prefix-cache and VRAM-registry tests as
  distinct `.exe` targets. Native file IDs and 100 ns last-write timestamps
  prevent an in-place GGUF edit from reusing a stale prefix within the same
  second; the VRAM and output tests are portable across Windows/POSIX.
- GPU header embedding is explicitly UTF-8/LF, so the generated-header drift
  gate is deterministic across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Agent conformance

- New agent-torture family, **schema-constrained selection from a large enum**
  (~50 labels) — the structured-labeling task small models fail by emitting a
  plausible near-miss; schema-constrained decoding forces an exact member.

### Notes

- `--gpu-layers N` forces N leading layers on the GPU; `--reserve-vram PCT`
  caps usage. Runner still binds loopback-only by default.

## v0.1.2-alpha — 2026-07-22

- Compatibility evidence: real OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs, LiteLLM, LangChain, and a
  llama.cpp reference matrix. Earlier phases: strict tool-call schema engine,
  streaming agent events, Responses + Messages APIs, shared weights, continuous
  batching, prefix caching, q8 KV cache.

## v0.1.1-alpha — 2026-07-19
## v0.1.0-alpha — 2026-07-17

- Initial public alpha: dependency-free C inference server for GGUF models
  (CPU/CUDA/Metal), OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, sampler-level JSON-schema
  enforcement.
