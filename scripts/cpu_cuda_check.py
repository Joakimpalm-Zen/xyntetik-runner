"""CPU vs CUDA byte-identity gate for one model, over several prompts.

The compatibility program's `cpu_cuda` check: the same greedy generation must
come out byte-for-byte identical whether the forward pass ran on the host or
on the device.

Each backend is loaded ONCE and driven over HTTP, rather than re-launching the
CLI per prompt. That is not a style preference: on a box whose RAM is smaller
than the model, alternating two processes over the same mmap evicts the page
cache on every switch, so a ten-launch run re-reads tens of gigabytes and
measures the disk instead of the engine.

MoE byte identity is defined over the EAGER routing path
(`RUNNER_MOE_EAGER=1`), because the fused path's device `expf` differs from the
host libm by 1-2 ulp by construction — so this harness pins it, exactly as the
other certification harnesses do. `RUNNER_CUDA_TC=0` pins the scalar GEMM for
the same reason (the tensor-core default is tolerance-gated, not identical).

Usage: cpu_cuda_check.py MODEL [--tokens N] [--runner PATH] [--fused]
Exit status is 0 only if every prompt matched.

# ---- MoE margin-qualified tolerance (owner-ratified 2026-08-20) ------------
#
# Dense models keep strict byte-identity. But top-k MoE routing has a hard
# ceiling: a genuine near-tie between two expert gates flips under CPU-vs-CUDA
# reduction-order FP rounding (warp-tree vs SIMD-lane), and that flip cascades
# into the token stream. Forcing the CUDA reduction to mimic host libm summation
# order purely to pass a byte-equality gate tests floating-point EXECUTION ORDER,
# not correctness. So a divergence is TOLERATED, and only then, when ALL hold:
#   (1) near-tie: the first divergent token is a coin-flip NEITHER side could
#       separate — the pick_margin to the OTHER side's picked token sits within
#       the band on BOTH sides. The band + pick_margin are bar-v2's exact FUNCTION
#       (scripts/kld-compare-raw.py, 0.5 nats, measured to the picked token);
#       requiring it on both sides is a deliberate TIGHTENING over bar-v2's
#       one-sided reference test — for cpu_cuda neither engine is "the reference",
#       so a flip only qualifies when both engines were genuinely unsure.
#   (2) fidelity: the model's independent bar-v2 fidelity gate passes (checked by
#       certify-envelope.py, not here).
#   (3) no systematic bias: the tolerated flips are a few INDEPENDENT near-ties,
#       not a pattern — capped at NEAR_TIE_CAP of the probes; more than that reads
#       as a real skew, not routing chaos, and FAILS.
#   (4) exactness elsewhere: any divergence whose first flip is NOT a near-tie is
#       a hard FAIL — a real, non-coin-flip difference.
# The result is REPORTED, never hidden: `pass` (all exact) / `pass_margin_qualified`
# (some near-ties tolerated) / `fail`.
