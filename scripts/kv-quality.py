"""Quality gate for a lossy KV cache: does q8 make the model WORSE?

The token-divergence gate (scripts/kernel-verify.py) answers a different and
much weaker question — how *often* q8 changes the output. A cache that changed
every token but kept every answer right would fail that gate; a cache that
changed one token and turned every answer wrong would pass it. Neither is what
we care about shipping.

So this script scores task success, f16 vs q8, on the two workloads the phase
actually claims ("long-context structured agents"):

  retrieval  needle-in-haystack. A fact is buried at a known depth in a long
             document full of same-shaped distractor facts, and the model must
             read it back. This is the workload that stresses a lossy cache
             hardest: the answer exists only in the KV cache, nowhere in the
             recent tokens, so any information the quantizer destroyed is
             information the model cannot recover.

  tools      structured tool selection. Pick the right function from a menu of
             plausible ones and fill its arguments, both with a short prompt
             and with a long irrelevant history in front of it. Scored on
             tool-name accuracy and on exact argument match.

Both suites run at temperature 0 on byte-identical prompts, so the KV cache
format is the only variable.

The comparison is PAIRED — every case is run under both cache types — so the
result is reported as McNemar discordant counts (f16-right/q8-wrong vs
f16-wrong/q8-right) with an exact two-sided p-value, not as two independent
accuracies whose confidence intervals happen to overlap. At these trial
counts, unpaired intervals would be far too wide to conclude anything.

    python scripts/kv-quality.py --models models/Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf
    python scripts/kv-quality.py --all --out results.json --gate

Exit 0 unless --gate is passed and q8 is materially worse (see --max-drop).
