"""What will this `--type-plan` actually produce? Answer from the header.

A type plan is written blind. Its rules are substrings matched first-wins, so
`{"match": "output.weight"}` also claims every `attn_output.weight`; and the
quantizer silently DECLINES a rule it cannot honour — a target block width
that does not divide the row (`type_fits_row`, 256 for the K-quants, 32 for
q8_0/q4_0) or a target that would grow the tensor (the never-grow rule). Both
declines produce a successful build and a file that is not what the plan said.
On a 30B parent that is a wasted hour per mistake.

This reads only the GGUF header and tensor directory — never the tensor data —
applies the same rules `src/quantize.c` applies, and prints the resulting byte
size, the per-type histogram the quantizer will print, and every rule it will
decline.

    scripts/type-plan-size.py MODEL.gguf PLAN.json [--json]

Prune plans change the tensor directory's contents and are not modelled here;
this answers the precision question only.
