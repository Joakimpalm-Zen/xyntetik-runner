"""Byte-exact conformance gate: runner's native C chat renderer vs each
family's UPSTREAM jinja chat template.

Runner renders chat templates natively in C instead of executing the model's
jinja template. That is deliberate (no jinja interpreter in the inference
path, and constrained decoding needs the framing as structure rather than as
text), but it means every family can silently DRIFT from its reference and
nothing notices -- goldens written from runner's own output only prove
self-consistency. tests/test_template.c is exactly that kind of golden. This
script supplies the missing oracle.

For each family it:
  1. loads the upstream `chat_template` (HuggingFace tokenizer_config.json /
     chat_template.jinja, or tokenizer.chat_template out of a local GGUF),
  2. renders a fixed conversation matrix through it with transformers-
     compatible jinja semantics (trim_blocks + lstrip_blocks, raise_exception,
     strftime_now, bos_token/eos_token, add_generation_prompt),
  3. renders the SAME matrix through runner's C renderer
     (render_messages_with_tools, via scripts/template-conformance-render.c),
  4. diffs byte-for-byte, and subtracts the deviations runner takes ON PURPOSE
     -- scripts/template-conformance-allowlist.json, every entry carrying a
     written reason and a source citation the harness re-verifies,
  5. subtracts the differences already KNOWN to be bugs --
     scripts/template-conformance-baseline.json, a backlog with per-entry
     status, not permission.

    make template-conformance            run the gate
    make template-conformance-refresh    re-fetch the upstream oracles first
    make template-conformance-baseline   re-record the known-difference backlog

Exit status:
    0   every selected family checked; no new drift; allowlist healthy
    1   NEW drift, drift that CHANGED SHAPE, a fixed-but-still-listed backlog
        entry, an upstream oracle that moved, or a rotted allowlist entry
    2   NOT CHECKED -- jinja2 missing, no compiler, or an oracle that could
        not be obtained. This is never reported as conformance. A gate that
        quietly checks nothing is worse than one that fails.

# not OpenAI messages, and src/server.c:handle_chat() does that flattening --
# content part-arrays, tool_calls, harmony's turn explosion, ornith's tool ->
# user rewrite, the tool-declaration system turn. This harness USED to
# re-implement that in python, which made the tool rows a comparison of jinja
# against a COPY of runner rather than against runner, and which could not
# express a part-array at all.
#
# It now hands scripts/template-conformance-render.c the request body
# verbatim, and that driver #includes src/server.c and runs the real
# handle_chat. Both sides of the diff are fed the same conversation, and the
# only thing between the request and the renderer is runner's own code. See
# the driver's header comment for the single documented substitution
# (add_generation_prompt, which handle_chat hard-codes to true).

# ------------------------------------------------------ the harmony oracle
#
# Harmony's reference is a LIBRARY, not a template, so it cannot be cached as
# a .jinja next to the others. Two ways in, in this order:
#
#   1. render live, through any interpreter that has openai_harmony (this
#      one, or RUNNER_HARMONY_PYTHON). Always preferred: a live library
#      cannot go stale.
#   2. the committed fixture scripts/template-conformance-harmony-oracle.json,
#      so a machine without the library still checks harmony instead of
#      skipping it. Regenerate with `make template-conformance-harmony-oracle`.
#
# With neither, harmony is NOT CHECKED -- exit 2, never a pass. And when BOTH
# are present the fixture is verified against the live render, so a fixture
# recorded from an older library version is reported rather than trusted.

# Every subprocess this harness runs is captured as BYTES and decoded here,
# never through `text=True`. Two independent reasons, both found on Windows
# 2026-08-14 while making the gate run there at all:
#
#   * `text=True` returned `stdout is None` -- with `stderr` correctly `''`
#     and returncode 0 -- for a ~31KB `input=` payload on CPython 3.12.10,
#     while the identical call in bytes mode returned all 30604 bytes. Small
#     payloads were fine, which is exactly the kind of size-dependent fault
#     that would have read as "Windows is flaky" forever.
#   * `text=True` decodes with the LOCALE encoding. The box is Swedish, so
#     that is cp1252, and this gate compares prompts BYTE-EXACTLY -- the
#     unicode-emoji and typographic-quote cases would have come back
#     mojibake and diffed against a reference that was never wrong. A
#     byte-exact comparison has no business going through a locale codec.

# --------------------------------------------------------- the token check
#
# The gate compares TEXT, and text is not what the model reads. Whitespace
# that looks cosmetic in a diff is not cosmetic to a tokenizer: `[INST] X
# [/INST]` and `[INST] X[/INST]` are different SentencePiece sequences, and
# that difference -- one extra token per occurrence on
# Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, measured on hardware -- is exactly the defect the
# first family in the fix campaign has. A text-only gate cannot tell whether a
# renderer fix changed what the model actually sees, or only how the diff
# reads.
#
# So the check is ALWAYS ON wherever it can run, rather than a mode or a
# per-family opt-in:
#
#   * a separate mode would not be running during the campaign it exists to
#     protect, and
#   * a per-family opt-in makes "nobody enabled it here" indistinguishable
#     from "it passed", which is the failure this whole script is against.
#
# It runs for any family with a tokenizer on the shelf, needs no flag, and
# reports THREE states per case exactly as the text check does: agreed,
# differed, or NOT CHECKED because no tokenizer for that family was found.
# NOT CHECKED is never folded into the pass -- it is counted, printed, and
# named in the final line. `--require-tokens` promotes it to exit 2, which is
# what the per-family fix runs should use.
