"""Deterministic tool-calling adaptation dataset (train + held-out eval).

Four tools with distinct JSON-schema arg shapes, natural-language requests
generated combinatorially from templates, plus refusal cases (requests whose
tool is NOT in the available set must answer {"tool": "none", "args": {}}).
The behaviors targeted are the ones the engine's own tool discipline cares
about: pick the right tool, produce schema-shaped args, refuse nonexistent
tools, and emit no prose around the JSON.

Everything is seeded and order-stable: the emitted files are byte-identical
across runs, so the dataset sha256 in a training provenance record is
meaningful.

Usage: make-tooluse-data.py <out-dir>   (writes train.jsonl + eval.jsonl)
