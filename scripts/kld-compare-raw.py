"""Cross-engine KLD/top-1/top-8 comparison over RAW (non-chat) completions.

kld-compare.py compares next-token distributions via /v1/chat/completions,
which is correct for two RUNNER instances (same chat-template renderer on
both sides) but unsound across engines for architectures with a structured
chat format: gpt-oss's Harmony template is rendered differently by the
runner (plain conversational continuation) and by llama.cpp (forces
`<|channel|>` markup via response schema), so a chat-endpoint comparison
finds the two engines' TEMPLATES disagree, not their WEIGHTS -- measured
directly during the cert-matrix session (0% top-1, KLD 31.2 via chat,
collapsing to near-perfect agreement via raw completions on the identical
question). This script does the same word-by-word teacher-forcing KLD
protocol as kld-compare.py, but against /v1/completions (no template
applied on either side), and normalizes the two engines' differing
logprobs response schemas (runner: parallel tokens/token_logprobs/
top_logprobs arrays; llama.cpp: content list of {token, logprob,
top_logprobs} dicts).

Same approximation caveat as kld-compare.py: KLD is restricted to the union
of both sides' top-N logprobs and renormalized over just that union.

Usage:
  kld-compare-raw.py --model-a A.gguf --runner ./runner \\
      --endpoint-b http://127.0.0.1:PORT --model-name-b NAME \\
      --corpus FILE.txt --max-positions 400 --out result.json

# ------------------------------------------------- quality bar v2: near-ties
#
# Plain top-1 agreement counts every argmax flip as a disagreement, including
# flips between two tokens the REFERENCE itself could barely separate.
# Measured 2026-08-13 on this box, that is exactly what the middle of the
# quality ladder fails on: granite-4.1-3b Q6_K scored mean KLD 0.0155 (three
# times inside the 0.05 bound) while missing 97% top-1 by four points, and
# Phi-4-mini Q8_0 scored KLD 0.0082 with 94.75% top-1. Distributions that
# close are not damaged; their argmaxes are coin-flipping.
#
# BAND DERIVATION, against the precedent this project already uses.
# test_tc_tol forgives a top-1 flip whose top-two gap is within TIE_FRAC =
# 0.02 of the logit range. Logprobs are shift-invariant softmax outputs, so a
# top-two LOGPROB gap is numerically the same quantity as a top-two LOGIT gap.
# The mean logit ranges tc-tol measures on real models here are ~25.5
# (Llama-3.2-3B) to ~53.4 (Phi-4-mini), so its band is 0.51 to 1.07 nats. We
# take 0.5 — the conservative end of that translation, forgiving strictly less
# than tc-tol would on every model measured. In probability terms the runner-up
# must hold at least exp(-0.5) = 61% of the leader's mass.
#
# The margin is read from the REFERENCE side, never the variant's. A variant
# that is unsure where the reference was certain has lost something real; a
# variant that picks differently where the reference had no opinion has not.
#
# And the gap is measured TO THE TOKEN THE VARIANT ACTUALLY PICKED, not between
# the reference's own #1 and #2. v2 measured the latter (2026-08-14 to
# 2026-08-19) and the difference is not cosmetic: "were the reference's top two
# close?" is a question about the reference alone, so a near-tie at the top
# forgave every flip beneath it. A reference of {x: -1.0, y: -1.2, z: -12.0}
# has a 0.2-nat top-two gap, and a variant confidently emitting z -- which the
# reference rates at e^-12 -- scored as agreement. The band exists to forgive a
# coin-flip between candidates the reference cannot separate, not to forgive
# anything at all whenever a coin-flip exists somewhere in the distribution.
