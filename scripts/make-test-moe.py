"""Generate a matched dense + MoE GGUF trio for the MoE equivalence test.

The three files share every weight except the FFN, and each MoE variant is
constructed to be MATHEMATICALLY IDENTICAL to the dense model's FFN, so the
runner's already-trusted dense path is the oracle — no separate reference
engine is needed. All weights are F32, so there is no quantization error and
the greedy output must be byte-identical.

                     FFN == dense, expert 1 = zeros. Weight of the one expert is
                     1.0, so output == dense exactly. Validates: metadata parse,
                     router matmul+softmax+top-1 selection, 3D expert slice at
                     offset 0, SwiGLU, and that expert 1 does not leak in.

                     exactly, so output == dense. Validates: top-2 selection,
                     renormalization summing to 1, the weighted multi-expert sum,
                     and reading BOTH expert slices (offsets 0 and 1).

# The dense-oracle fixtures above cannot discriminate a gating function: with a

# real router and experts that disagree — where each gating function must yield
# a visibly different answer. They are not dense-equivalent and are compared
# against each other, not against dense: the property is "this knob changes the
# arithmetic", which is exactly what the oracle fixtures cannot show.
#
# Every fixture here shares ONE router: _seed is rewound before each build, so
# moe_ffn_routed draws the same ffn_gate_inp weights every time and the ONLY
# difference between these files is the gating metadata. The first version drew
# a fresh router per fixture, which made them differ for a reason that had
# nothing to do with gating — a binary that ignores expert_gating_func entirely
# passed the whole gate (verified by mutation 2026-08-19).
#
# rsmw pairs with rsoftnn, not rsoft, and both turn expert_weights_norm OFF.
# Gating 3 (softmax over the SELECTED weights) with the norm ON is
# arithmetically IDENTICAL to gating 1 plus the sum-renormalization — softmax
# over the top-k logits IS the renormalized top-k of the full softmax — so under
# the default norm the knob has no observable effect and no fixture can detect
# it. With the norm off, gating 3 still normalizes (its own softmax does) and
# gating 1 does not, which is where the knob becomes visible.
