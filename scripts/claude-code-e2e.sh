# Claude Code against Runner, end to end.
#
# The README claims Claude Code compatibility. Until this script existed that
# claim rested on a validation someone ran by hand once, against one version,
# with the commands in their shell history — which is the kind of claim that
# stays in a README long after it stops being true. This makes it repeatable.
#
# What it proves: the real Claude Code binary, pointed at Runner with
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, completes a built-in `Read` tool loop and returns a
# sentinel that exists nowhere but the fixture file. That is a full round trip
# through /v1/messages -- system turn, tool declarations, a tool_use block, a
# tool_result replayed in the next turn -- driven by a client nobody here
# wrote.
#
# What it does not prove: model quality. The task is deliberately trivial and
# the tool set is restricted to Read, so a failure means a protocol problem
# rather than a small model wandering off.
