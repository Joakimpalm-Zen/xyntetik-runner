# The agent torture suite

A standalone, adversarial agent-conformance suite. It runs one repeatable
request matrix that stresses the things real agent harnesses break on — nested
tool arguments, forced truncation mid-call, tool selection under pressure, and
transport-invariant streaming — and reports a verdict per request with enough
preserved evidence to audit every one.

It is **runtime-agnostic**: the same matrix runs against Runner or any other
OpenAI-compatible server (llama.cpp's server, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio), so
results compare directly on identical hardware. The bar is not "did it answer" — it is
"did it emit *exactly one* valid tool call, select the *right* tool, produce
arguments that satisfy the schema, and stream in a way that does not depend on
how the bytes were chunked."

## What it tests

| Category | What breaks without it |
|---|---|
| `nested_arguments` | Deep object/array/enum argument schemas — the shape most tool-call parsers mangle. |
| `tool_selection` | The right tool chosen from several, under a forced `tool_choice`. |
| `forced_truncation` | A hard token ceiling landing *inside* a tool call — the arguments must still be valid JSON. |
| `stream_normalization` | SSE that normalizes to the same result regardless of TCP segmentation, ends with `[DONE]`, and carries a real finish reason. |
| `large_enum_selection` | A single-choice label from a ~50-member enum — the structured-labeling task small models fail by emitting a plausible near-miss outside the enum; schema-constrained decode must force an exact member. |
| `reasoning_then_tool` | Earlier assistant prose must not bleed into the subsequent forced tool-call turn. |
| `structured_final` | A schema-constrained final answer exercises `response_format`, independently of the tool path. |

## Run it

```bash
# Runner (spawned locally on the CPU, deterministic):
python3 scripts/agent-torture.py --model path/to/model.gguf --cases 100

# Runner speculative-decode runtime axis. This runs a target-only baseline,
# then the identical cases with the draft, and fails if any verdict changes:
python3 scripts/agent-torture.py --model qwen2.5-7b.gguf \
    --draft qwen2.5-0.5b.gguf --draft-k 4

# Any OpenAI-compatible server already listening on localhost:
python3 scripts/agent-torture.py --endpoint 127.0.0.1:8080 \
    --runtime llama.cpp --runtime-version b3200 --model qwen2.5-7b --cases 100
python3 scripts/agent-torture.py --endpoint 127.0.0.1:11434 \
    --runtime ollama --model qwen2.5 --cases 100
python3 scripts/agent-torture.py --endpoint 127.0.0.1:8000 \
    --runtime vllm --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --cases 100
```

`--endpoint` is loopback-only on purpose: the runtimes under comparison run on
the same box (identical hardware is the whole point). Tunnel a remote runtime
to a local port first (`ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 host`).

### Starting the other runtimes

```bash
# llama.cpp
llama-server -m model.gguf --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --jinja

# Ollama (its OpenAI-compatible surface is on /v1)
ollama serve                # then: ollama pull qwen2.5 ; it serves on 11434

# vLLM
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# LM Studio (its OpenAI-compatible server; start it from the app or the CLI)
lms server start --port 1234    # then: agent-torture.py --endpoint 127.0.0.1:1234 \
#                                        --runtime lmstudio --model <loaded-model>
```

Any OpenAI-compatible server works the same way — point `--endpoint` at its
loopback port and label it with `--runtime`. The four above are the ones the
positioning matrix names; the harness does not special-case any of them.

## What you get

Two files under `--out` (default `tests/torture/out/`):

- `report.json` — runtime name + version, model, per-category pass/fail
  totals, `valid_structured_tasks_per_second`, elapsed, and peak RSS (Runner
  only — a foreign process's RSS is not read). Labeled with the runtime, so
  two runtimes' reports diff directly. `totals` reports **two arms
  separately** (schema `v4`): a turn that emits no call at all is `declined`
  (the model answered in prose), split out from the `attempted` cases where a
  call was produced. `call_rate` = attempted / requests answers *did it call?*;
  `attempted_pass_rate` = passed / attempted answers *when it called, was the
  call right?*. Every case here offers the tool under a forced `tool_choice`,
  so a runtime that enforces the choice (Runner) has `declined` 0; one that
  lets the model decline is measured on the decline arm rather than conflated
  with one that emits a broken call — a low overall score then reads as "didn't
  call" or "called wrongly", not an undifferentiated fail.
  A third outcome, `excused` (since 2026-10-03, narrowed the same day): a
  `forced_truncation` case at `max_tokens` 1 whose single token went into a
  reasoning model's reasoning channel (Runner's
  `runner_telemetry.finish_detail` is `reasoning_limit` and no call was
  begun). Under a constraint the engine closes reasoning at half the budget
  and spends the rest on the call, so one token is the only budget that
  cannot be split. The case is counted in `requests` and `excused` and left
  out of `scored`, `failed` and both rates. The same no-call at a budget of 2
  or more FAILS (`reasoning reserve did not hold`): it would mean that close
  regressed. Granite 4.2 at `max_tokens` 1 is the instance (3 of 120 on
  2026-10-02).
  **Comparing runtimes on a reasoning model:** only Runner reports the
  signal, so another runtime's budget-1 no-call is scored as `declined` where
  Runner's is excused. The report and the printed summary always carry
  `requests`, `scored` and `excused` together; on a reasoning model compare
  runtimes on `requests`, or drop the budget-1 `forced_truncation` cases for
  every runtime, never the excused count of one against the declined count of
  another.
- `raw.jsonl` — one line per request: the exact request body, the raw response
  (base64, so nothing is lost or reinterpreted), the normalized stream where
  applicable, and the failure category on a miss. Every verdict is auditable
  from this file alone.

With `--draft`, `baseline/report.json` and `baseline/raw.jsonl` preserve the
target-only control. The top-level report adds `speculative_decode` counters
(`drafted`, `accepted`, acceptance rate, and grammar counters) and a
`verdict_mismatches` list. A mismatch makes the command fail: speculation is
an optimization axis, never a different test family or an excuse for a changed
answer. A run with zero proposals also fails, so an ignored or accidentally
dropped draft flag cannot produce a vacuous green result. `--draft` therefore
applies only to locally spawned Runner, not an arbitrary `--endpoint`.

## Reproduce and compare

The matrix is deterministic: `build_cases(N)` returns the same requests every
run, round-robin across categories, so a diff between two `report.json` files
is a diff between two runtimes — not two random samples. To publish a
comparison, run the same `--cases N` against each runtime on the same machine
and commit all four `out/` directories side by side.

Ollama routes on the OpenAI `model` field, so pass `--model-name <name>` (the
name you gave `ollama create`); Runner and llama.cpp ignore it. The flag is
recorded in `raw.jsonl` so the request stays reproducible.

Summarize any set of reports into one leaderboard (ordered best-first, each
column labeled by the report's own runtime):

```bash
python3 scripts/torture-compare.py results/*/report.json          # text
python3 scripts/torture-compare.py --md results/*/report.json     # Markdown
```

Published competitor rows are checked weekly against the runtimes' official
release metadata by `.github/workflows/competitor-freshness.yml`. The workflow
does not install runtimes, load models, or run inference: it reads
`runtime.name` / `runtime.version` from the reports and queries GitHub Releases
for llama.cpp and Ollama and PyPI for vLLM. The rows are dated snapshots, so
the job reports how far each one is behind in its run summary and stays green:
it files no issue and does not fail when upstream moves on (until 2026-10-02 it
did, on every minor Ollama or vLLM release). Re-measurement happens in
certification windows on owned hardware, which read that summary. An
unreachable registry is printed as `SKIP`; malformed committed report metadata,
no published rows, or every registry lookup failing still fail the job, because
those are defects in this repository.
Run the same inexpensive check locally with:

```bash
python3 scripts/competitor-freshness.py
```

## Published comparisons

Both runs below predate the `large_enum_selection` category (added 2026-07-24),
so their totals cover the four original categories.

- [2026-07-21 — Runner vs llama.cpp vs Ollama, Llama-3.2-3B, CPU](../tests/torture/results/2026-07-21-llama-3.2-3b-cpu/README.md):
  Runner 12/12, llama.cpp 5/12, Ollama 5/12. The split is exactly the schema
  cases — Runner wins `nested_arguments` and `forced_truncation` 3/3 vs 0/3;
  the rest are close. (llama.cpp is far faster on raw CPU throughput — that is
  the other axis, and the readout is honest about it.)
- [2026-07-22 — Runner vs llama.cpp, SmolLM2-1.7B, CPU](../tests/torture/results/2026-07-22-smollm2-1.7b-cpu/README.md):
  Runner 12/12, llama.cpp 3/12. On a model this small, llama.cpp's Jinja
  template path emits no parseable tool call at all (all 9 failures are
  "got None"), while Runner's schema-constrained sampling — template-independent
  — still lands every call. The wedge widens as the model weakens; the readout
  is explicit that this is a mechanism difference, not the model reasoning better.

The current matrix is **v3 (120 cases, eight categories)**: the atem work
added `tool_stream_normalization` (streamed tool-call verification), and 105
does not divide by eight, so the count moved to 8 x 15 = 120. Earlier result
sets remain valid on their own terms and are not case-for-case comparable
with v3.

One result set uses the current v3 matrix:

- [2026-08-19 — Runner vs llama.cpp vs Ollama vs vLLM, SmolLM2-1.7B, v3 matrix](../tests/torture/results/2026-08-19-smollm2-1.7b-refresh/README.md):
  Runner 120/120, vLLM `0.27.1` (`--tool-call-parser hermes`) 80/120, llama.cpp
  `b10488` 30/120, Ollama `0.32.14` 28/120. Refreshes the three competitor
  runtimes to the current upstream releases (the [freshness ledger](#published-comparisons)
  the weekly workflow checks); llama.cpp and Ollama fail every tool-call family
  through their chat-template paths — the same mechanism finding as the small-model
  rows above — while their non-tool families pass.

Three older result sets use the v2 matrix (105 cases, seven categories):

- [2026-08-03 — Runner vs vLLM, SmolLM2-1.7B, v2 matrix](../tests/torture/results/2026-08-03-smollm2-1.7b-v2/README.md):
  Runner 105/105, vLLM (`--tool-call-parser hermes`) 80/105. **This is the
  correction of record** for the withdrawn 2026-08-02 run below.
- [2026-08-02 — Runner vs vLLM (WITHDRAWN)](../tests/torture/results/2026-08-02-smollm2-1.7b-vllm/README.md):
  do not quote its 20/100 — vLLM was started without a tool-call parser, so 80
  cases failed at admission; correctly configured it scores 80/105. Kept, with
  its correction banner, so the correction is checkable.
- [2026-08-03 — Runner-only, Qwen2.5-7B, v2 matrix](../tests/torture/results/2026-08-03-qwen2.5-7b-v2-matrix/README.md):
  105/105, plus the finding that the matrix's token budgets measure
  non-thinking models (Qwen3-4B scores 15/105 because its thinking prelude
  consumes the constrained budget).

## Copy-ready client examples

The suite speaks the OpenAI tool-call contract, so these clients target Runner
(or any runtime) unchanged — point the base URL at the server.
