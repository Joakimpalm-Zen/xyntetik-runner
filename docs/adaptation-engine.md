# The adaptation engine: scoring, adapters, and training in the serving binary

*2026-08-22. Status: D1–D9 built and gated (scoring, adapters, backward,
training, GRPO-lite, CUDA slices 1–2, the position-batched backward
(slice 3), merge). CPU-hosted training, position-batched and threaded
under a byte-exact contract, with an opt-in device assist. Everything below with a number attached was
measured, and the gates named here run in `make test`.*

The runner can now score, adapt, and train — narrowly scoped as **LoRA
adaptation of a frozen quantized base, in the same binary, on the same
kernels** that serve the model. Not pretraining, not a framework: a GGUF
that learns locally, reproducibly.

## Why inside the inference engine

The systems argument: when the trainer's forward pass is literally the
inference forward pass — same kernels, same bits — the policy you sample is
the policy you train, **by construction**. Train/infer numerical mismatch
(the thing that silently breaks on-policy RL and motivated the industry's
determinism work) cannot occur between two codepaths that are one codepath.
The second claim is **deterministic training**: same data + same seed →
byte-identical adapter file, which extends the runner's reproducibility
discipline from "prove what it said" to "prove what it learned from."

Both claims are gated, not asserted (see D5 below).

## D1 — `--score`: teacher-forced logprobs

Per-token log P(token | prefix) over raw text, plus NLL and perplexity, as
versioned JSON (`xyntetik.runner.score.v1`). The eval/reward primitive
everything else builds on.

Design finding, measured during its red-first gate: **the CPU batched
forward is not bit-identical to solo forwards** (max |Δlogprob| ~1e-6 on the
fixtures). Sampling-time logprobs come from solo decode forwards — so the
scorer *defaults to the solo path*, and the ~10×-faster chunked pass is an
opt-in (`RUNNER_SCORE_CHUNKED=1`) whose deviation envelope is pinned by
test. Semantic sanity: a natural sentence scores ppl 15.3 where its
word-shuffled anagram scores 1818 (SmolLM2-135M Q8_0).

## D2 — `--lora`: adapters at inference

llama.cpp adapter-GGUF naming (`blk.N.<proj>.weight.lora_a/_b`,
`adapter.lora.alpha`), f32 deltas applied as `y += scale·B(Ax)` beside the
untouched base matvecs on the CPU dense projections (attention
q/k/v/output, FFN gate/up/down). Fails closed by name on shape/rank
mismatches, unknown targets, unsupported architectures, and GPU-resident
models. Gated through `--score`: a zero adapter is byte-identical to the
bare base; a real adapter matches the merged-weights reference model within
the float summation-order envelope (5e-4). The adapter id joins the engine's
model identity, so a cached prefix can never serve across an adapter
boundary.

## D3 — the backward pass

Activation gradients flow through the whole network in reverse — attention
including the cross-position dK/dV paths, the rope adjoint, the softmax
jacobian, rmsnorm backward — while weight gradients exist only for the
adapters. Three properties carry the design:

1. **The forward half is the inference forward.** Solo forwards tape each
   layer's residual-stream input; the backward recomputes internals with the
   same primitives (`rmsnorm`, `matvec_b`, the production attention worker)
   and reads K/V from the actual cache, so the values differentiated are the
   f16-rounded values inference attended over.
2. **The transposed quantized matvec** (`dx = Wᵀ·dy` through frozen
   quantized rows, per-row dequant, serial fmaf) carries the frozen-base
   activation gradients — for any weight type the engine can decode, and
   FD-verified through real Q8_0 rows, not just F32.
3. **Byte-determinism**: fixed sequential fmaf accumulation everywhere.

Gate: finite differences on 84 coordinates across all 28 adapter buffers
(every slot × both layers × A and B × F32 **and** Q8_0 bases), aggregate
cosine 0.99997, gradients byte-identical run to run. The gate's design
itself records a measurement: the f16 KV cache **staircases** finite
differences (probed: fd oscillates around the analytic value and converges
to it as eps grows), so the check is two-scale rather than
single-tolerance. Teeth proven by sabotage: a deliberately broken rope
adjoint fails at relative error 1.36.

Declared scope, fail-closed by property: CPU, dense SiLU transformers, f16
KV. Recurrent architectures, MoE, sliding windows, per-head norms and head
transforms refuse with a named reason.

## D4 — `--train`: the loop

Fresh rank-R adapters on every hooked projection (A seeded, B zero — an
exact no-op start), AdamW (0.9/0.999, wd 0.01) in fixed elementwise order,
per-step JSONL loss logging, checkpoints via an adapter-GGUF writer that
emits exactly the format `--lora` reads. Two data modes:

- plain text: tokenize, fixed windows, cycle;
- `.jsonl` lines `{"prompt", "completion", "weight"}`: prompt transitions
  masked to weight 0, completion transitions carry the example weight —
  `model_lora_backward_w`'s per-position weights are the policy-gradient
  hook.

Determinism is the default: fixed init seed unless `-s` is given, fixed
data order, the D3 compute path underneath.

## D5 — the gates (`make test`)

- **Deterministic training**: two identical runs → byte-identical adapter
  files and identical loss trajectories.
- Loss falls on an overfit corpus; the saved adapter loads back through
  `--lora` and improves `--score` on the trained text (fixture: nll
  5.58 → 4.59).
- JSONL mode trains with prompt masking; a different seed produces a
  different adapter (the determinism is seeded, not vacuous).
- Plus the D3 FD gate on both base types.

## Measured at scale (Blackwell, 128-thread CPU path)

**Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct Q4_K_M** (a frozen 4-bit base learning through the
transposed-quantized-matvec path), rank-8 adapters on every projection,
corpus = this repository's README introduction (164 words), 30 AdamW steps
at ctx 96, lr 2e-4, 32 threads:

| measure | value |
|---|---|
| step wall time | ~33 s (992 s for 30 steps) |
| training loss | 5.11 → 0.14 |
| exact corpus text, nll/token | **5.00 → 0.31** (ppl 148 → 1.4) |
| unrelated control sentence | 1.63 → 1.67 (barely moves) |
| off-corpus paraphrase | 6.20 → 6.65 (overfit, as expected) |

The paraphrase row is kept deliberately: 30 steps at lr 2e-4 on 164 words is
memorization, and an honest overfit report shows the specificity — the
adapter learned exactly the trained text, left the control alone, and got
slightly worse at near-miss phrasings. Generalization tuning is a recipe
question, not an engine question.

## D6 — GRPO-lite: reinforcement with zero train/infer mismatch

`scripts/train-grpo-lite.py`: sample K completions per prompt from the
runner itself (seeded — the sampling replays), score with a task reward
(built-in task: emit exactly one valid tool-call JSON object), convert
group-relative advantages (r − mean r) into weighted examples, take one
weighted `--train` pass, repeat. REINFORCE at example granularity —
deliberately the simplest correct member of the GRPO family, because the
demonstration is the mechanism: the sampler and the trainer are the same
binary, so the improvement loop has no numerical seam at all.

**Measured (SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct Q4_K_M, 4 tool-call prompts × K=8, 6
rounds, lr 2e-5, Blackwell CPU path).** Two runs, both reported because the
failed one taught more:

- **Raw advantages (r − mean), lr 1e-4 — the policy COLLAPSED**: valid-call
  rate 0.91 → 0.78 → 0.94 → 0.88 → 0.59 → **0.09** → 0.38. On a
  high-baseline task the rare failures carry advantage ≈ −0.9 while the many
  successes carry ≈ +0.1; the asymmetric negative mass unlearns the shared
  structure. The textbook naive-REINFORCE failure, reproduced in an
  afternoon on a laptop-class stack — which is rather the point of having
  the loop this cheap to run.
- **Group-normalized, clipped advantages ((r − mean)/std, ±1), lr 2e-5 —
  stable and improving**: 0.906 → 0.906 → 0.875 → 0.938 → **0.969** →
  0.938 → 0.938 (mean reward 0.906 → 0.947). Modest headroom — the base
  model is already decent at the task — but the loop climbs instead of
  detonating, and the whole run replays from its config (seeded sampling +
  deterministic training).

Verdict against the item's own kill-switch ("the RL demo underwhelms →
supervised LoRA remains the product"): the mechanism is demonstrated — the
sampler and trainer share every bit, the loop improves a real quantized
model, and the stabilization it needed is the standard one, arrived at by
measurement. A product-grade recipe (KL anchoring, bigger prompt sets,
harder rewards) is future work, not engine work.

## D8 slice 1 — the transposed matvec on device

The deterministic-training claim extends to the GPU only if the GPU produces
the same BYTES as the CPU backward. Slice 1 delivers that for the backward's
dominant primitive: `k_mvt_{f32,f16,bf16,q8_0,q4_0,q4_K,q6_K}` compute
`dx += Wᵀ·dy` with the CPU trainer's exact accumulation chain (accumulator
starts from dx, serial j per output element, fmaf, zero-dy skip), and the
gate (`test-mvt`, in `make test`, self-skipping without CUDA) byte-compares
the float buffers against the CPU path on real fixture and real-model
tensors. Measured on the RTX 3070 (CUDA 13.3): **bit-identical on every
type**, first try for five of seven. Throughput, honestly: with per-call
PCIe transfers the f16 head wins 1.9× over one CPU thread, while the naive
per-element q6_K decode LOSES (0.6×) — the primitive's win needs persistent
device buffers and a tiled decode, which is what the remaining D8 slices
(integrated training-side GPU context, batched taped forward) are for. What
slice 1 establishes is the hard part: determinism does not have to be traded
away to move training onto CUDA.

## D8 slice 2 — the persistent training context (integrated, measured, not yet winning)

Slice 2 integrates the primitive: `RUNNER_TRAIN_GPU=1` gives `--train` a
standalone CUDA context (the model stays CPU-resident and unbound — the
serving offload is never engaged), uploads each weight tensor **once** on
first use, and routes the backward's `dx += Wᵀ·dy` through the slice-1
kernels with reused scratch. Any tensor that cannot go to the device (no
kernel for its type, VRAM budget reached) silently stays on the CPU path —
free to mix, because both paths are gated byte-identical, so the adapter
bytes cannot depend on the switch. Gated in `make test`
(`test_train.py::test_gpu_training_matches_cpu_bytes`, self-skipping
without CUDA) and verified at 4B scale on Blackwell-generation hardware
(RTX PRO 6000, a second GPU generation after the slice-1 RTX 3070): CPU
and GPU-assisted runs produce **byte-identical adapters** with identical
loss trajectories.

Measured honestly, it does not win yet: 6 training steps of the 4B
ToolUse config took 284 s on 96 EPYC-class CPU threads and 430 s
GPU-assisted (a 1g.24gb MIG slice). Removing the per-call weight upload
was necessary but not sufficient — the backward makes tens of thousands
of batch-1 mvt calls per step, and per-call dy/dx transfer plus
synchronization now dominates. The win requires batching the backward
across positions (one device call per site covering the whole window),
which is the next slice, alongside the tiled q6_K decode. What slice 2
banks is the structure and the guarantee: determinism survives
integration, on two GPU generations, at 4B scale.

## D8 slice 3 — the position-batched backward: 2.3× on the CPU, measured honestly

Slice 2's verdict ("the wall is batch-1 calls") led here: the backward ran
its transposed matvec once per position — ~28k batch-1 calls per 4B step,
the lm-head backward alone re-decoding all 152k vocab rows every position.
Slice 3 makes every projection site ONE batched call over the window
(site-major passes, the head chunked at 16 positions) and rebuilds the
CPU matvec around the invariant that actually matters: **each dx[t][i]
accumulates its ascending-j fmaf chain from its incoming value**, which is
loop-order-, partition- and thread-count-invariant. Workers own
(column-slice × position-chunk) cells, decode only their slice — every
weight element decodes once per position chunk instead of once per
position — and no element is ever touched by two workers. The
score/softmax backward threads the same way over kv-head groups (each
dk/dv element belongs to one group; the group's (t,h,s) loop is the
serial order restricted to its slice).

Because all of that is scheduling, the bytes cannot move, and the gates
say they didn't: an adapter trained by the pre-slice-3 binary is
**byte-identical** to one trained after (tiny fixture and 4B scale), the
bytes are invariant across thread counts, and the FD gradient gate holds
at worst relative error 0.

Measured on the 4B ToolUse config (96 EPYC-class threads, ctx 128):

| | s/step | phase profile (s) |
|---|---|---|
| before slice 3 | 47.3 | head-dominated re-decode |
| after slice 3 | **20.5** | fw 5.5 · sites 7.2 · recompute 3.2 · B2/B3 2.1 · attn 0.8 · head 0.4 |

Each optimization round was driven by `RUNNER_TRAIN_PROF=1` (per-step
phase wall times) after the first guess — that dy scanning dominated —
measured out as wrong (a threaded transpose bought 3%). The profile
found the real ceilings: the serial O(T²) attention backward (~15 s,
now 0.8), and the column-partition capping the matvec at 10 workers
(15–17 s, now 7.2).

How to read training speed here: the KPI is **time-to-adapter under the
reproducibility contract** — the published ToolUse adapter (316 steps)
now trains in ~1.8 hours on a 96-thread CPU host, byte-identical across
reruns, down from ~4.2. Per-step JSON carries `step_s` and `tok_s`
(training tokens/sec: forward + backward + optimizer, ~5.4 at seq 110 /
batch 1 — not an inference number) for normalized comparisons across
configs. Dense-training metrics like MFU are deliberately not quoted:
under batch 1 + frozen quantized base + serving numerics + byte-exact
output, the peak-FLOP denominator is artificial. The clean future
benchmark is Runner against Runner — CPU deterministic vs CUDA
deterministic, same data, same convergence, same adapter sha if the
contract survives the kernel batch grid.

The GPU assist after the same batching: **still loses, now by more**
(49 s/step vs 20.5 on a 1g MIG slice), byte-equal as always. The
transfers amortized as intended, but the `k_mvt_*` kernels parallelize
over n_in only — 2,560 device threads on a 2,560-wide input is two
orders of magnitude under GPU occupancy. The remaining GPU slice is a
kernel-side batch grid (positions as blocks), which needs a PTX
regeneration; it is deprioritized while the CPU path is the one winning,
and RUNNER_TRAIN_GPU=1 stays an opt-in that changes step time, never
bytes.

## D9 — `--merge-lora`: folding the adapter into the base

Serving `base + --lora` is the exact form: the frozen base plus an F32
delta, every base identity gate still valid, provenance = base sha +
adapter sha. But an adapter only helps runner users. `--merge-lora OUT`
produces the portable form — a standalone GGUF with
`W' = W + (alpha/r)·B·A` folded into each adapted projection, runnable in
any GGUF runtime:

```sh
runner -m base-Q4_K_M.gguf --lora adapter.gguf --merge-lora merged.gguf
runner -m base-Q4_K_M.gguf --lora adapter.gguf --merge-lora merged-f16.gguf --quant f16
```

Mechanics, and where the honesty lives:

- Each adapted tensor's rows are dequantized, the delta is folded in a
  fixed-order fmaf chain (the same discipline as `lora_apply`), and the row
  is requantized — to its own source type by default, or to `--quant T`.
  **Merging into a quantized type rounds the delta through that type's
  grid.** The merged file is NOT numerically the served base+adapter; how
  much of the learned behavior survives the rounding is a *measurement*,
  per target type, not a given. The exact form stays `--lora`.
- Untouched tensors (and zero-delta pairs) are copied byte-verbatim — no
  gratuitous dequant/requant churn of weights the adapter never touched.
  Gated: merging the all-zero adapter writes a file byte-identical to a
  keep-type requant of the base.
- The merge is deterministic: same base + adapter + flags → byte-identical
  merged file, and on an F32 base the merged floats are gated *byte-exactly*
  against the documented fmaf chain (`test-quantize`).
- Validation mirrors `model_lora_load` (hostile-GGUF discipline): unknown
  projections, shape/rank mismatches, half pairs, and architecture
  mismatches refuse the whole merge — a silently skipped tensor would emit
  a merged model that is not base+adapter.
- Provenance extends D7 to the standalone artifact: `OUT.merge.json`
  carries base/adapter/merged sha256s plus the scale and target, so the
  merged blob remains auditable back to what it was made from.

Requantizing into K-quant bases needed writers the requantizer didn't have:
faithful ports of ggml's `Q4_K` and `Q6_K` quantizers (and a
round-to-nearest-even `BF16`) now sit beside the existing `q8_0/q4_0/q3_K`,
gated on round-trip error through the production dequant readers and on
byte determinism. They are general: `--quantize` and `--type-plan` accept
`q3_k`, `q4_k`, `q6_k`, and `bf16` targets now too.

### Measured: the 4-bit merge erases the fine-tune

The ToolUse adapter (the published Qwen3-4B artifact: base+adapter scores
1.000 exact on the held-out eval, base alone 0.690) was merged into three
output precisions of its Q4_K_M base and each standalone file re-evaled
(128-thread EPYC-class host, greedy, temperature 0):

| merged into | right tool | exact call | bytes changed vs base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q4_K_M (keep) | 0.724 | 0.690 | **1.45%** |
| Q8_0 | **1.000** | **1.000** | ~all (type change) |
| F16 | **1.000** | **1.000** | ~all (type change) |

The Q4_K_M merge does not degrade the adaptation — it **deletes** it: the
merged file reproduces the base's numbers to the prompt, because the LoRA
delta is small against the 4-bit grid step and requantization rounds
98.55% of the weight bytes back to their original codes. The symptom is
visible in one generation: through stock llama.cpp (b10581, raw
completion), the Q8_0 and F16 merges answer with JSON only, exactly as
trained; the Q4_K_M merge answers, then drifts into conversational prose —
the base's habit the adapter had trained away.

At 4B scale the merge determinism held too: two independent
`--merge-lora` runs of the Q4_K_M target produced byte-identical 2.5 GB
files (same sha256).

The deployment rule this measures out to: **serve 4-bit as
`base + --lora` (exact); merge only into Q8_0 or wider, and eval the
merged file, not the adapter.** Merging into a 4-bit base is where a
fine-tune silently disappears — precisely the failure a workflow that
never re-evals its merged artifact would ship. Interop is verified the
same way: the merged files load and generate correctly in stock llama.cpp.

### Measured: the survival threshold (delta magnitude vs the 4-bit grid)

If the mechanism is "delta smaller than the grid step rounds away", the
delta's magnitude should be the knob — and `--lora-scale` at merge time is
that knob for free. The same adapter merged into the same Q4_K_M base at
five scales, each merged file evaled standalone, with the served
base+adapter at the same scale as the control:

| scale | merged-Q4 exact call | served exact call | bytes changed vs base |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 0.690 (base) | 1.000 | 1.15% |
| 1 | 0.690 (base) | 1.000 | 1.45% |
| 2 | 0.690 (base) | 1.000 | 2.05% |
| 4 | 0.828 | 1.000 | 2.87% |
| 8 | **1.000** | **0.138** | 4.60% |

Two findings. First, survival is monotone in delta magnitude, as the
mechanism predicts: at 2× the delta still rounds away entirely, at 4× it
partially lands, at 8× it fully lands — for this adapter and task the
behavioral threshold sits between ~2.9% and ~4.6% of weight bytes
actually changing. Second, the inversion at 8×: the *exact* 8×-scaled
adapter breaks the served model (0.138 — over-amplified), while the
Q4-merged version of the same weights scores 1.000. The 4-bit grid acts
as a soft threshold on the delta — it keeps the components large enough
to land and rounds away the rest, which at 8× amounts to an accidental
regularizer. Do not read that as a technique; read it as the measurement
that merging through a quantization grid is a *filter* on your fine-tune,
with a pass-band you don't control. Scaling an adapter 8× to survive a
4-bit merge hands the filter a model the exact form of which you can no
longer serve.

## Measured: weight-space divergence IS behavioral — one level below top-1

The three-precision study left a question on the table: the bf16- and
Q4_K_M-trained adapters diverge 12% in weight space while every top-1
metric sits at 1.000 — is the divergence real behavior or numerical
trivia? The external reproduction proposed the right instrument before
new benchmarks: compare held-out token logprobs. All 29 eval prompts,
gold completions appended, scored through the SAME Q4_K_M serving base
under each adapter (3,195 scored positions):

| pair | weight rel L2 | mean \|Δlogprob\| | p95 | positions >1 nat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bf16-ad vs Q8-ad | 0.019 | **0.020** | 0.086 | 0% |
| bf16-ad vs Q4-ad | 0.122 | **0.146** | 0.65 | 2.2% |
| Q8-ad vs Q4-ad | 0.120 | 0.145 | 0.49 | 2.3% |
| base vs any adapter | — | 0.32–0.40 | ~1.1–1.7 | 6–8% |

Read: the divergence is real behavior. The Q4-trained adapter differs
from the bf16-trained one by roughly **40% of the entire adapter effect**
in logprob space (0.146 vs ~0.36), with a 6× weight-space gap mapping to
a 7.4× logprob gap — essentially proportional. It is invisible at top-1
only because this task's decisions have wide margins; on a task whose
decisions sit closer to zero margin, this is the size of gap that flips
answers. "Fine-tune FP16 then quantize" and "adapt the deployed quant"
are not just measurably different objects — they are measurably
different *behaviors*, one level below where the eval saturates. Raw
per-position score outputs are in the HF repo (`evals/logprob-study/`).

## The predicted flip, found externally

The section above ends on a prediction: the Q4-trained adapter's 0.146 mean
|Δlogprob| gap "is the size of gap that flips answers" on a task whose
decisions sit closer to zero margin. That was written as an expectation with
no instance behind it.

The instance came from outside. The same HF contributor whose reproduction
scopes the determinism claims below built a **36-prompt tool-choice boundary
bank** (five ambiguity families: `list_dir`/`search_files`,
`read_file`/`search`, `read_file`/`write_file` multi-intent, config browsing,
and available-tool/none), screened it for cases whose top1-top2 legal-choice
margin sits at or under 3 nat, and compared the base and the BF16-, Q8- and
Q4-trained adapters on the survivors, generating the full JSON
deterministically wherever the branches disagreed.

Seven cases passed the screen. **One split, and it survived full generation:**

| prompt | base | BF16-ad | Q8-ad | Q4-ad |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *tell me what README.md says and translate it* | `search_files` | `read_file` | `read_file` | **`none`** |

Two caveats, both his, both load-bearing:

- **This is an existence proof, not a rate.** One split out of seven selected
  out of 36. The screen selects on the Q4 adapter's own margin, so the seven
  cases cannot estimate any general margin distribution.
- **There is no monotonic precision law here.** Several cases had smaller Q4
  margins, not all did, and one case had **Q8** as the tightest condition. What
  this supports is that some decision boundaries are far more sensitive to the
  training precision path than others, and that the direction is not monotone
  in bit width. It does not support "lower training precision degrades tool
  choice", which his own data refutes.

He also assigned no gold labels, deliberately, on the grounds that doing so
would convert a decision-sensitivity probe into a quality benchmark and quietly
change the question. That reasoning is adopted here.

One methodological note worth carrying: his first version scored full tool-name
sequences and was discarded once BPE merged punctuation across the apparent
string boundary, which made the score invalid. Runner's `choice_logprobs` is
not exposed to that failure mode, because it records the legal alternatives as
the grammar defines them rather than as text.

**Read against the merge study above, these are two different mechanisms and
must not be collapsed into one claim.** Merging an adapter into a 4-bit base
erases it, because the grid rounds the delta away. Training *through* a 4-bit
base yields an adapter that is present and effective, and that picks a
different branch at a tight boundary.

## Reproducibility, scoped by an external reproduction

An independent reproduction (HF forum, 2026-08-23) confirmed the
determinism claim on hardware this project never touched — including the
GPU-assisted backward on a **Tesla T4** (a third GPU generation, and
exactly the sm_75 floor the embedded PTX targets): identical adapter
sha256 and loss, CPU vs GPU, byte for byte. The same report contributed a
finding we had not measured: **rebuilding from source under a different
ISA profile changes the adapter bytes** (behavior essentially unchanged,
cosine ~1.0). The mechanism is libm: the trainer's fmaf chains are
pinned, but SiLU and softmax call `expf`, whose implementation varies
with compiler codegen and ISA profile.

The reproduction's three-level taxonomy is adopted here, with credit:
(1) **artifact determinism** — same binary + same inputs → same adapter
bytes: claimed and gated; (2) **build reproducibility** — independent
rebuilds byte-agree: NOT claimed, and now known to fail at the libm/ISA
boundary; (3) **behavioral reproducibility** — same predictions/task
performance: measured by the evals. The `.train.json` provenance record
carries the running binary's own sha256, compiler, OS and arch, so any
reproduction report can distinguish "same executable" from "same source"
mechanically.

## Interop, measured in both directions

The "format matches llama.cpp's by construction" claim graduated to
measurement:

- **Outbound**: the published ToolUse adapter, served by *stock llama.cpp*
  (b10581, `llama-server --lora`, raw completion), scores **1.000 /
  1.000 / 1.000 / 1.000** on the full 29-prompt held-out eval — identical
  to runner serving it. The adapter is a first-class llama.cpp artifact.
- **Inbound**: the first community adapter tried (a third-party Qwen3-4B
  LoRA GGUF from HF) exposed a real gap — llama.cpp's
  `convert_lora_to_gguf` emits **F16** tensors and the loader was
  F32-only. Fixed and gated (F32/F16/BF16 accepted, converted
  deterministically at load; quantized adapter tensors still refuse by
  name): the community adapter now loads (144 adapted projections),
  generates coherently on the Q4_K_M base, and measurably shifts `--score`
  (nll 2.904 → 2.783 on a greeting prompt — it is applied, not just
  accepted).

## Honest limits

- The training loop is CPU-hosted; RUNNER_TRAIN_GPU=1 offloads the
  backward's dominant matvec (D8 slice 2), but the forward, the attention
  backward and the optimizer still run on the CPU — larger bases want a
  many-core box (the M1-class floor is ~2B models per the T0 memory
