# Tray / menu-bar controller

The tray puts a small icon in the macOS menu bar or the Windows notification
area. Clicking it shows **every runner instance live on the machine** — however
it was started — with its loaded models, and lets you stop any of them or
launch one pre-configured "desktop-managed" server. macOS and Windows only in
v1; on Linux `--tray` prints an honest error.

`--tray` means *be* the tray rather than run a model, and is required wherever
there is no terminal (launchd, Task Scheduler, a service wrapper). A session
you sit with — a bare invocation, `--serve`, or `-i` — raises one for you and
leaves it running afterwards; one-shot `-p` runs and tooling modes do not, and
`--no-tray` opts out everywhere. The README's Desktop tray section has the full
table.

That spawned tray is a detached child with its own session, so Ctrl-C on a
server does not reach it. Beyond raising it, the only thing the tray adds to a
normal run is the discovery record described below, and writing it is
best-effort: a failure to write never affects the run.

## How instances are discovered

Every runner process in a *run* mode (one-shot generation, `--serve`,
`--tray` itself) writes one JSON record at startup:

```
~/.xyntetik/runner/instances/<pid>.json          (macOS, Linux)
%APPDATA%\xyntetik\runner\instances\<pid>.json   (Windows)
```

```json
{"pid": 4711, "started": 1785940000, "mode": "serve", "port": 8080,
 "version": "0.1.8-alpha",
 "models": [{"name": "trinity.gguf", "path": "/abs/path/trinity.gguf"}]}
```

Records are written atomically (tmp + rename) and removed at normal exit.
A crash leaves a stale file; **every reader sweeps** — any record whose pid
is no longer alive is deleted on sight, so the directory is self-healing.
Utility modes (`--quantize`, `--caps`, `--bench-json`, `--version`) do not
register.

A swap-mode server (`--serve` with a `name=path` model list) registers with
an empty models array because its resident set changes at runtime; the tray
asks the instance itself with `GET /v1/models` on loopback (500 ms budget)
each time the menu opens, and shows `(no model resident)` if nothing is
loaded or the call fails.

## The menu

- Header row: `xyntetik-runner <version>`.
- One row per live instance: `mode  ·  :port  ·  pid` (`●` marks the
  tray-managed instance). Its submenu lists the model names and a **Stop**
  item. The tray itself is never listed — only things you can manage are.
- **Start default runner** — spawns `runner --serve -m <last_model> --port
  <port> <last_args>` as a detached child. With no model configured the row
  reads `Start… (no model configured)` and opens the native file picker
  (filtered to `*.gguf`); the choice is saved and the server starts.

The managed instance always shows its lifecycle explicitly — reopen the
menu to see the current state:

| State | What the menu shows |
|---|---|
| starting | `● starting <model>… (loading model)` with a **Cancel start** submenu; the Start row reads `Default runner: starting…`. Large models take several seconds to load. |
| running | The normal `●` instance row with models and **Stop**; the Start row becomes the label `Default runner: running on :<port>` (no silent-no-op click). |
| exited on its own | `⚠ default runner exited (failed start or crash)` with a **View log** row and a **Restart default runner** action. The warning clears when you restart, stop, or quit. |
| stopped by you | Back to the plain **Start default runner** row — an intentional stop is not an error and leaves no warning. |

The managed server's stdout+stderr go to `<config_dir>/managed.log`
(truncated on each start), so **View log** always has the failure story.
- **Choose model…** — same picker, any time.
- **Launch at login** — checkbox, see autostart below.
- **Quit controller** — stops the tray **and the instance it manages,
  nothing else**. Instances you started by hand are never touched by quit.

Stop semantics: SIGTERM, 3 s grace, SIGKILL on macOS. On Windows v1 uses
`TerminateProcess` directly — there is no portable graceful signal for a
console process outside your own console group; the registry record is
swept either way, and the server holds no state that outlives the process.

The icon is the Xyntetik ensö, the same drawing as the brand mark, and carries
three states, refreshed every 5 s: the bare ensö when no runner is registered,
the ensö with the spark on its end when one is up with a model resident, and
the full Runner mark (ensö, spark and three streaks) while inference is in
flight. The
third is read from `active_requests` in `/health`; when it cannot be read the
icon falls back to "model loaded", since an unreachable-but-live server still
has a model resident. See the README's Desktop tray section for the table.

Only one tray runs per machine: a second `--tray` exits with an error
naming the live controller's pid.

## Config file

```
~/.xyntetik/runner/config.json          (macOS, Linux)
%APPDATA%\xyntetik\runner\config.json   (Windows)
```

```json
{"last_model": "/abs/path/model.gguf", "last_args": "-c 4096", "port": 8080}
```

`last_args` is a space-split argument tail appended to the managed server's
command line. This field is the seam the calibration profiles
(Brain/Balanced/Fastest) will write into later; the tray itself only ever
records your file-picker choice in `last_model`.

## Autostart

- macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.xyntetik.runner.tray.plist`
  (RunAtLoad, starts only the tray — never a model).
- Windows: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, value
  `XyntetikTray`.

The checkbox creates or removes exactly that one artifact; presence of the
artifact is the state.

## Uninstall notes

Remove, if present:

- the autostart artifact above,
- `~/.xyntetik/runner/` (POSIX) or `%APPDATA%\xyntetik\runner\` (Windows) —
  contains only `config.json` and the self-healing `instances/` directory.

Nothing else is written anywhere (`managed.log` lives inside the same
`runner/` directory).

## v1 simplifications (documented, deliberate)

- Windows stop is `TerminateProcess` (no `WM_CLOSE`/console-ctrl attempt).
- The Windows icon is drawn white-on-black regardless of taskbar theme
  (macOS uses a template image and adapts automatically).
- No load/unload of individual models from the menu — the runner has no
  unload API; you stop the instance instead.
- Registry refresh is poll-on-open plus a 5 s badge timer, not a
  filesystem watch.

## Headless validation seam

`XYNTETIK_TRAY_DUMP=1 runner --tray` prints the exact menu the backend
would render (indentation = submenus, `*` = clickable, `[x]` = checkbox
state) and exits without touching the GUI. CI and remote validation diff
this output; the human checklist only has to confirm the pixels.

`XYNTETIK_TRAY_ICON_DUMP=<dir> runner --tray` is the icon sibling: it renders
all three states to `<dir>/tray-{idle,loaded,running}` and exits — PNG on
macOS, BMP on Windows. Eighteen pixels of arcs cannot be reviewed by reading
the drawing code, so a design change is checked by looking at these. Both
backends paint from one geometry scaled to the requested size, so the review
render and the live icon are the same drawing rather than two that can drift.
