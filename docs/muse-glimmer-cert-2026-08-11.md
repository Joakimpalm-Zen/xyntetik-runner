# muse-glimmer (Meta Muse Glimmer 30B) certification — 2026-08-11

## Verdict: CERTIFIED-WITH-CAVEAT (official kquant, text path)

Load, tokenizer (0/721), cpu_cuda (6/6 byte-identical), fixture-scale
CPU↔Metal identity, and chat all PASS. The caveat is greedy identity vs
llama.cpp b10353: **3/6 byte-identical**, and the sensitivity-floor
protocol (the afmoe-session lesson) shows the gap sits at the model's own
numerical floor rather than above it:

- llama.cpp vs ITSELF (cold vs warm cache): 15/16 identical — the
  reference alone cannot do better than 1-in-16 disagreement.
- runner vs itself (f16 → q8 KV): 12/16 identical, mean Δlogprob 0.0029.
- runner vs llama.cpp (16 prompts, 64 tok, tie bar 0.25 nats): 11/16
  identical, 4 divergences at near-ties, **1 for real** — max Δlogprob
  0.178 (afmoe FAILED this same reading at 1.867 nats with 3/6 real).

Cross-engine disagreement ≈ the runner's own KV-perturbation floor
(11/16 vs 12/16), so the 3/6 headline is numerical tie-breaking on a
4-bit quant, not a wrong implementation — the same class as the certified
gemma-4-12B row (4/6 with degenerate long runs).

Environment: runner `2ce691f` (the arch-port commit), llama.cpp reference
**b10353** (the build that introduced muse-glimmer support, merged
2026-08-10 — pinned as this arch's reference revision; the rest of the
matrix stays on its own pins), Blackwell box (RTX PRO 6000 MIG 1g.24gb,
conda ccbuild toolchain). Reference built CPU-only, static
(`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` — the shared build silently resolved the conda
env's older libllama via RPATH and refused the arch; a stale-reference
failure mode worth remembering).

Artifact under test (arch certification): the OFFICIAL meta-models GGUF
`muse-glimmer-30B-kquant-17gb.gguf`, 16.8 GB 4-bit k-quant, sha256
`7e9b74b7c8875e9e265695df9613bf6290f2392e479ce740495a129019c488d8`.
Text path only: the separate vision encoder (`mmproj-kquant.gguf`) and the
atem tool-call syntax are not implemented and not claimed.

## Gates

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| fixture suite (M1 + CI-shape) | **PASS** — load/determinism/gate-participation/pattern-array tests green; CPU↔Metal byte-identical on all three muse fixtures (default, gate-flat, all-swa) on an 8 GB M1 |
| tokenizer differential | **PASS — 0/721** vs the HF reference tokenizer (`meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B` tokenizer.json, `tokenizers` 0.22.2). The new `llama4` → o200k split rules are exact on the full corpus |
| cpu_cuda | **PASS — 6/6 byte-identical** on the full cert prompt set (a/b/c/d at 64 tokens, b-long/c-long at 256) at full offload (52/52 layers, 16.8 GB in VRAM). Notably prompts a, d and b-long are internally CPU==CUDA identical while diverging from llama.cpp — engine-internal determinism holds everywhere |
| greedy identity vs llama.cpp b10353 | **3/6 byte-identical** (b, c, and the 256-token c-long). The three divergences (a @byte 114, d @byte 222, b-long @byte 323) all split DEEP into an identical prefix — the near-tie signature, not early structural divergence; both tails stay fluent and on-topic (b-long: `reverse_linked_list` vs `reverseList` naming). Read against the sensitivity floor below |
| chat smoke | **PASS** — real-weight `/v1/chat/completions` "What is 2+2? Answer with just the number." → `content: "4"`, reasoning cleanly separated into `reasoning_content` (the ` to=self` turn), `finish_reason: stop` via the new `<|eot|>` stop probe. TMPL_MUSE renders the model's own template shape |

## Footprint (route A) — 16 GB-Mac quant certification

KLD protocol: `kld-compare-raw.py`, raw completions, word-boundary teacher
forcing over `tests/fixtures/mixed-corpus.txt`, top-20 union approximation,
all arms CPU-served by the same runner build. Harness validated first:
official-vs-official self-comparison over 100 positions scored **exactly
mean KLD 0.0 / top-1 100% / top-8 overlap 1.0**.

| candidate | size | result |
|---|---|---|
| bartowski IQ3_XXS | 11.5 GB | ~~REFUSED (no IQ1–IQ3 dequant, type 21)~~ → loads after the same-day i-quant port (runner `792d316`, owner-approved): IQ1_S/M, IQ2_XXS/XS/S, IQ3_XXS/S transcribed from llama.cpp b10353, gated 7/7 byte-identical vs llama-server on llama.cpp-quantized fixtures, plus real-file greedy identity on this exact file. **KLD: FAILS — top-1 81.25%, mean KLD 0.152**, top-8 0.796 |
| bartowski IQ3_XS | 12.3 GB | **FAILS — top-1 80.75%, mean KLD 0.132**, top-8 0.808 (best of the sub-4-bit tier, still nowhere near the bar) |
| bartowski Q3_K_S | 12.8 GB | **FAILS the quality gate** — 400 positions: top-1 **81.25%**, mean KLD **0.153**, top-8 overlap 0.788, vs the ≥97% / ≤0.05 bar. Same-engine quant-vs-quant with an exact-zero baseline, so this is pure quantization damage |
| bartowski Q2_K | 11.0 GB | **FAILS, worse** — top-1 **72.0%**, mean KLD **0.253**, top-8 overlap 0.745. The degradation gradient is monotone with bits, as expected |

Agent-torture on Q3_K_S (GPU-served, 105 requests): **71/105**, and the
split matters more than the total — tool_selection 15/15,
structured_final 15/15, stream_normalization 15/15, nested_arguments
14/15, forced_truncation 12/15; ALL 30 hard failures are
large_enum_selection/reasoning_then_tool **transport timeouts** (the
reasoning model thinking past the harness's 120 s deadline at ~19 tok/s),
not wrong answers. The agentic verdicts that measure correctness pass;
the failures measure latency of a thinking model under a fixed clock.

**Route A verdict: quantization-only does NOT fit this model into the
16 GB-Mac envelope at certification quality — measured across BOTH quant
families.** All four sub-13.3 GB candidates cluster at the same wall
(three independent 3-bit formats land within 81±0.5% top-1 / 0.13–0.15
KLD; 2-bit drops to 72%/0.25), so this is a property of the checkpoint at
3 bits, not of any one quantization scheme. The sub-4-bit wall previously
measured on much smaller models holds at 30B: the official 4-bit
(16.8 GB) is the floor of certifiable quality, and it needs a 24 GB-class
machine. Engine follow-up DONE same session (owner-directed): NEON + AVX2 dequant
kernels for all seven i-quant types at the dequant_block seam (runner
`7156690`), differential-gated on both ISAs against independent
double-precision references and re-verified byte-identical to llama.cpp
on the real IQ3_XXS file. Measured on the 30B (Blackwell CPU): decode
0.76 → 2.21 tok/s (2.9x), prefill 3.8 → 9.4 tok/s (2.5x). Device
kernels remain future work with no current quality case.

## Footprint (route B) — depth-prune kill-experiment

Owner-directed ("test all options"). Method: layer influence measured on
the official kquant with the new `RUNNER_LAYER_SIM` diagnostic (residual
input/output cosine over a real-text calibration prefill; block influence
= 1 − cos), then `scripts/gguf-depth-slice.py` cuts the least-influential
layers from the official Q4 GGUF directly — surviving layers keep their
exact certified bytes, per-layer metadata arrays travel with their
layers, no HF-side toolchain needed (mergekit has no muse_glimmer
definitions). Scoring reproduced the ShortGPT shape exactly: early layers
load-bearing (cos 0.61–0.71), deep-middle 22–31 and late 40–48 most
redundant (cos ≥ 0.925).

**A tooling defect was caught before any verdict:** the slicer's first
version read every blob from garbage offsets (data_start computed before
the tensor table) while producing a loadable, deterministic file that
collapsed identically on BOTH engines — cross-engine agreement does not
clear a tool that corrupts the input both engines read. Caught by an
independent byte-integrity comparison, fixed in `4114f77`, and the
fixture gate now compares surviving tensor bytes.

With the fixed tool (greedy, "The capital of France is"):

| variant | size | behavior |
|---|---|---|
| keep-50 (−2 layers) | 16.2 GB | coherent ("…is in Paris. Paris is known for its beautiful architecture…") |
| keep-48 (−4) | 15.7 GB | fluent but evasive — dances around naming Paris |
| keep-40 (−12) | 13.3 GB | word-salad collapse |
| keep-38 (−14) | 12.7 GB | numeric garbage |

KLD vs the official kquant (same 400-position protocol as route A):

| variant | size | top-1 | margin-qualified top-1 | mean KLD | top-8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| keep-50 (−2) | 16.2 GB | **66.75%** | not measured | 0.394 | 0.676 |
| keep-48 (−4) | 15.7 GB | **58.0%** | not measured | 0.681 | 0.578 |

**Verdict: KILL, decisively.** Removing TWO of 52 layers does more damage
(66.75% top-1) than compressing every weight to 3 bits (81%), while
saving 0.6 GB where the 3-bit quants save 4.5–5.3. Quantization
dominates depth-pruning at every measured point of this checkpoint's
frontier; the −12-layer cut the envelope requires collapses the model
outright. Un-healed depth-pruning of a dense distilled checkpoint
behaves exactly as the literature warned — now measured, not assumed.

## DFlash drafter

The published 1.63 GB `dflash-kquant.gguf` is its own architecture
(`general.architecture: dflash`, 5 blocks over the shared 202k vocab) — a
DFlash block drafter, not a small muse-glimmer. It does NOT ride the plain
`--draft` path: the CPU verify path refuses it at admission with the loud
`unsupported architecture 'dflash'` error (fail-closed, same shape as the
Tier-3 `gemma4-assistant` REFUSED precedent), and a fully-GPU-offloaded
target ignores `--draft` by design. Consuming it would be a new drafter
arch, tracked as an open item, not smuggled in here.

## Notes

- CPU decode 5.5 tok/s (96 threads), CUDA full-offload decode 19.0 tok/s on
  the MIG slice; prompt 13–15 tok/s at this trivial prompt length.
- The model thinks by default (reasoning strength high in the reference
  system turn); `enable_thinking:false` pins the generation prompt to
  `<|start|>assistant to=user<|message|>`, which is the format's own way to
  suppress the reasoning turn.

## Re-measure addendum — 2026-08-21: upstream replaced the artifact; behavior unchanged

Upstream (`meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B-GGUF`) renamed and replaced the pinned
file: `muse-glimmer-30B-kquant-17gb.gguf` is gone; the current artifact is
`Muse-Glimmer-30B-KQuant-17GB-Q4_K_M.gguf` (16,756,683,904 B), sha256
`4cc57c0f51040a226e5a72cc47b7613f7772950e460a665f7083de89f183f60e`.

Re-measured on the new file with the original protocol (six greedy cert
prompts, CPU, temp 0, rstrip+sha256 of the completion): **6/6 runner outputs
byte-identical to the committed evidence** produced on the old artifact
(`muse-glimmer-evidence/remeasure-2026-08-21.json`). The replacement changed
the container, not the behavior under this protocol, so every gate verdict in
this document carries over; only the pinned sha above is superseded by the one
in `tests/compatibility/models.json`.
