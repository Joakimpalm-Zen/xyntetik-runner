// These are passed to CUDA kernels BY VALUE, so gcc (compiling src/cuda.c) and
// nvcc (compiling src/kernels.cu to PTX) must agree on their layout exactly.
// They used to be declared twice — once in each file — with nothing checking
// that the two stayed in step.
//
// That is a silent failure: adding a field to one side compiles cleanly on
// both, and the kernel then reads its arguments at the wrong offsets. It
// produces fluent, confident, WRONG output rather than a crash — on 2026-08-08
// exactly that happened while adding a field to attn_args, and the GPU emitted
// "The capital of France isnas!!!!!!!!" while the CPU path stayed correct.
// Without a CPU arm to compare against, that reads like a broken model file.
//
// One definition removes the failure mode entirely.
//
// Keep this header free of anything CUDA-specific: it is compiled as C by gcc
// and as C++ by nvcc, so plain structs and fixed-width integers only.
