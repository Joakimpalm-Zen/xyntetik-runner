// ------------------------------------------------- continuous batching
//
// Throughput problem: a decode step is weight-bandwidth bound, so N slots
// decoding independently read the same 2.5 GB of weights N times to produce N
// tokens. model_batch_decode reads them once for all N. The scheduler's whole
// job is to arrange for as many sequences as possible to be at the same point
// — "needs one token" — at the same instant, and hand them over together.
//
// The shape is forced by one constraint: a microbatch borrows its lead
// sequence's activation scratch and CUDA stream, so no slot may run its own
// model_forward while a batch containing it is in flight. Hence ONE decode
// thread issuing one step at a time, rather than a thread per slot.
//
// What stays on the slot threads is everything else: HTTP, prompt building,
// prefill, and — critically — the per-token sampler / schema / stop /
// streaming work, which is pure CPU and touches no shared model state. Slot
// threads run that concurrently while the decode thread is already gathering
// the next microbatch, and a slow client blocking on a socket write therefore
// stalls its own request instead of everyone's.
//
// A sequence is named per step, never enrolled (see model_batch_decode), so
// admitting, finishing, cancelling or timing one out is only ever a change to
// which slots are in SEQ_WAIT when the next batch is cut. Nothing is torn down.
