// Cross-process VRAM reservation registry.
//
// Multiple runners on one GPU are legitimate and required — the conformance
// harness and several tests spawn their own servers. What was missing was
// *accounting*: six orphaned `runner --serve` processes once sat on a 24GB MIG
// slice, one of them for 4h39m, and nothing in runner knew the others existed.
// A VRAM check failed and then passed on re-run; a benchmark ran under
// contention and its numbers had to be thrown away.
//
// So this is not a lock. It is a ledger, keyed by GPU device identity, that
// answers one question: *who is holding what right now*. When a claim does not
// fit, the refusal names every holder — pid, model, bytes, uptime — instead of
// reporting a bare out-of-memory.
//
// Two states matter, and conflating them is the easy mistake:
//
//   pending    registered, not yet allocated. The driver's free-VRAM figure
//              does NOT know about these, so they must be subtracted.
//   committed  allocated. The driver's free-VRAM figure ALREADY reflects them,
//              so subtracting them again would double-count and refuse claims
//              that in fact fit.
//
// Committed entries therefore contribute nothing to the arithmetic and
// everything to the message. That is the whole point: the scarcity is measured
// from the device, the blame is read from the ledger.
//
// A third, non-claiming state exists for --wait-for-vram: a live 'W' marker
// records that some pid is queued and at what priority, so other waiters can
// see it, but it holds zero bytes and never enters the fit arithmetic.
//
// This module is deliberately small: it tags claims with an advisory priority
// and lets a holder be asked (never forced) to yield. Fair-share, priority
// lanes, and actual preemption are policy, and policy lives above this file —
// see vram_claim's header comment for exactly where the line sits.
