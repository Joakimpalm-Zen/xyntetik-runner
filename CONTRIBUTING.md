# Contributing

Runner is in public alpha; bug reports with `runner --version` and
`runner --caps` output are the most valuable contribution.

When bumping the release, update `RUNNER_VERSION` in `src/runner.h` first;
the versions in `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` must match it verbatim, and
`python/pyproject.toml` must carry the same version in PEP 440 form (pre-release
suffixes translate: `X.Y.Z-alpha` → `X.Y.Za0`). The Python client remains a
separate distributable with no build-time coupling to the C header.

## Correctness gates (non-negotiable)

Every change must hold these invariants, in CI and locally:

1. **GPU output is token-identical to the CPU path on the certified scalar
   route.** Any kernel or offload change must produce byte-identical temp-0
   output vs `--gpu off` with the scalar/eager paths pinned (the tensor-core
   prefill default and fused MoE routing are separately held to their
   tolerance gates — `make test-tc-tol`, `make test-moe-tol`; see
   `docs/benchmarks.md` for the framing).
2. **gemma4 stays verified against llama.cpp** — token identity for the dense
   models; gemma-4-26B-A4B and the E-series are gated at the measured
   sensitivity floor instead (see `docs/compatibility-program.md` for why
   token identity is not claimable there). Don't drift.
3. **The CI matrix passes on Linux, macOS, and Windows** — including the
   sanitizer build (`make debug`, ASan/UBSan) and every smoke test.
4. **Schema guarantees are load-bearing.** Keys emit in declared order and
   truncated output still parses; the suite above runner depends on both.

## Building

    make            # or: make OS=Windows_NT CC=gcc under MSYS2 UCRT64
    make debug      # ASan/UBSan build

## Tests

Use `make test` for the fast schema and Python client correctness checks, and
`make smoke` for a short CPU-only end-to-end run. CI runs the full smoke matrix
on Linux, macOS, and Windows; new behavior lands with a smoke there (TDD: watch
it fail first).

`make test` is also a CI gate: the `make-test` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make` and `make test` on a Linux CPU runner,
so a check added to that target reaches CI without anyone also adding a step
for it. That is the point of the job — the hand-written steps in the other jobs
are a list nobody can keep complete, and a gate that only exists in `make test`
used to run on developer machines or nowhere.

The other jobs are not deduped against it and should not be: they cover macOS
and Windows, which `make-test` does not, and they run things `make test` does
not (the sanitizer build, the server smokes). Adding a step there is still
worth doing when the check needs a platform or a setup the `make test` job
lacks.

## README gate

Every public behavior change includes a README impact check. Features, fixes,
flags, API fields or routes, defaults, environment variables, platform or model
support, resource controls, and releases must update `README.md` in the same
commit when its account changes. Compare it with the shipped `--help`, `--caps`,
routes, and operator controls; remove stale or redundant statements as well as
adding missing behavior. New USP claims require a fresh check against current
official documentation for the relevant runtimes and must describe Runner's
distinct mechanism without unsupported market-wide claims.

## Architecture scope (the lean-engine boundary)

Runner stays a compact engine (~19K LOC) on purpose. Breadth is the failure
mode, so architecture support is admitted by decision, not accumulation:

- **Composable knobs over subsystems.** New model families should land as
  small orthogonal switches on the existing MoE/attention code (router
  options, attention sinks, NoPE, temperature scaling) — not as parallel
  forward paths.
- **Tier B stays declined in mainline.** MLA/DeepSeek-style latent attention,
  MTP heads, and linear/recurrent attention are not knobs; they change the
  attention path, the KV format, or both. They do not enter `model.c`.
- **The gated exception is Syntetik profiles.** Feasible model/runtime
  co-design for the suite's own model (MTP verifier, isolated MLA, shared
  experts, hybrid KDA) may land only behind an explicit versioned
  agent-profile admission: isolated behind a narrow attention/cache seam or
  build flag, tested with tiny generated GGUF fixtures, each with a measured
  trigger recorded before work starts. **No profile may leak complexity into
  the dense Llama path**, and a checkpoint requiring an unadmitted feature
  must fail closed at load rather than degrade silently.
- Everything above is still subject to the correctness gates: CPU==GPU
  token-identical, certified vs llama.cpp where a reference exists.

## Style

Plain C11 (gnu11), zero dependencies beyond libc/pthreads. Comments state
constraints the code can't show — not narration.

## Commit hygiene

Run `make hooks` once per clone. It points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`,
whose `commit-msg` hook refuses a message that carries a session URL or id,
a stray e-mail address, or a `Co-Authored-By` trailer that is neither the
agent form `<Agent> (<Model>) & Joakimpalm-Zen` nor a person's
`Name <email>` (see AGENTS.md). CI runs
the same check on every pull request, so the hook only moves the refusal
earlier.
